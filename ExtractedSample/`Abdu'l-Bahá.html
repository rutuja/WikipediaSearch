At the age of eight his father was imprisoned and the familys possessions were looted, leaving them in virtual poverty. Along with his father, `Abdul-Bahá was exiled to Baghdad where the family lived for nine years. In 1863 Baháulláh was again exiled to Constantinople. During the 1860s the family was banished from Constantinople to Adrianople, and then finally to the penal-colony of Acre, Palestine when he was 24. During his youth he was "shaped" by his father and was regarded as an outstanding member of the Bahá’í exile community. As a teenager he was his father’s amanuensis and was regularly seen debating theological issues with the learned men of the area.  journeys to Will and KBE after his personal storage of grain was used to relieve famine in Palestine following World War I, but never used the title.`Abdul-Bahá was born in Tehran, Iran on 23 May 1844 (5th of Jumada al-awwal|Jamadiyul-Avval, 1260 AH),    the eldest son of Baháulláh and Ásíyih Khánum|Navváb. He was born on the very same night on which the Báb declared his mission.    Born with the given name of `Abbás,  he was named after his grandfather Mírzá `Abbás Núrí, a prominent and powerful nobleman.    As a child, `Abdul-Bahá was shaped by his fathers position as a prominent Bábí. He recalled how he met the Bábí leader Táhirih and how she would take "me on to her knee, caress me, and talk to me. I admired her most deeply".  `Abdu’l-Bahá had a happy and carefree childhood. The family’s Tehran home and country houses were comfortable and beautifully decorated. `Abdul-Bahá enjoyed playing in the gardens with his younger sister whom he was very close to.    Along with his younger siblings— a sister, Bahíyyih Khánum|Bahíyyih, and a brother, Mírzá Mihdí|Mihdí— the three lived in a environment of privilege, happiness and comfort.  With his fathers declination of the position as minister of the court; during his young boyhood `Abdu’l-Bahá witnessed his parents various charitable endeavours,  which included converting part of the home to a hospital ward for women and children.    `Abdul-Bahá received a haphazard education during his childhood. It was customary not to send children of nobility to schools. Most noblemen were educated at home briefly in scripture, rhetoric, calligraphy and basic mathematics. Many were educated to prepare themselves for life in the royal court. Despite a brief spell at a traditional preparatory school at the age of seven for one year,  `Abdul-Bahá received no formal education. As he grew he was educated by his mother, and uncle.  Most of his education however, came from his father.  Years later in 1890 Edward Granville Browne described how `Abdul-Bahá was "one more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans...scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent."  When `Abdul-Bahá was seven, he contracted tuberculosis and was expected to die.  Though the malady faded away,  he would be plagued with bouts of illness for the rest of his life.   One event that affected `Abdul-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father when `Abdul-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children.  `Abdul-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Baháulláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál.  He described how "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In the middle of the stairway, all of a sudden we heard His  …voice: Do not bring him in here, and so they took me back".    mother and sister becoming constant companions.  `Abdul-Bahá was particularly close to both, and his mother took active participation in his education and upbringing.    During the two year absence of his father `Abdul-Bahá took up the duty of managing the affairs of the family,  before his age of maturity (14 in middle-eastern society)  and was known to be occupied with reading and, at a time of hand-copied scriptures being the primary means of publishing,  was also engaged in copying the writings of the Báb.    `Abdu’l-Bahá also took an interest in the art of horse riding and, as he grew, became a renowned rider.  Garden of Ridván Baháulláh announced to a few that he was the manifestation of God and He whom God shall make manifest whose coming had been foretold by the Báb. On day eight of the twelve days, it is believed `Abdul-Baha was the first person Bahaullah revealed his claim to.   ]]In 1863 Baháulláh was summoned to Constantinople (Istanbul), and thus his whole family including `Abdul-Bahá, then nineteen, accompanied him on his 110-day journey.    The journey to Constantinople was another wearisome  journey,  and `Abdul-Bahá helped feed the exiles.  It was here that his position became more prominent amongst the Bahá’ís.  This was further solidified by Bahá’u’lláh’s tablet of the Branch in which he constantly exalts his sons virtues and station.    The family were soon exiled to Adrianople and `Abdul-Bahá went with the family.  `Abdu’l-Bahá again suffered from frostbite.    In Adrianople `Abdu’l-Bahá was regarded as the sole comforter of his family – in particular to his Ásíyih Khánum|mother.  At this point `Abdul-Bahá was known by the Baháís as "the Master", and by non-Baháís as `Abbás Effendi ("Effendi" signifies "Sir"). It was in Adrianople that Bahá’u’lláh referred to his son as "the Mystery of God".  The title of "Mystery of God" symbolises, according to Baháís, that `Abdul-Bahá is not a manifestation of God but how a "person of `Abdul-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized".       `Abdul-Bahá was at this point noted for having black hair which flowed to his shoulders, large blue eyes, alabaster coloured skin and a slight Roman nose.  Baháulláh gave his son many other titles such as "the Most Mighty Branch" the "Branch of Holiness", "the Center of the Covenant" and the apple of his eye.  `Abdul-Bahá ("the Master") was devastated when hearing the news that him and his family were to be exiled separately from Baháulláh. It was, according to Baháís, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.   mother and father – and the grieving `Abdul-Bahá kept a night-long vigil beside his brother’s body.  == houses to be rented for the family, the family later moved to the Mansion of Bahjí around 1879 when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee. `Abdul-Bahá soon became very popular in the penal colony and Myron Phelps a wealthy New York lawyer described how "a crowd of human beings...Syrians, Arabs, Ethiopians, and many others",  all waited to talk and receive `Abdul-Bahá.  He undertook a history of the Bábí religion through publication of A Travellers Narrative (Makála-i-Shakhsí Sayyáh) in 1886,  later translated and published in translation in 1891 through Cambridge University by the agency of Edward Granville Browne who described `Abdul-Bahá as:  == As a young man speculation was rife amongst the Bahá’ís to whom `Abdul-Bahá would marry.   Several young girls were seen as marriage prospects but `Abdu’l-Bahá seemed disinclined to marriage.  On March 8, 1873, at the urging of his father,   the twenty-eight-year-old `Abdu’l-Bahá married Munírih Khánum|Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán (1847–1938) a twenty-five-year-old noblewoman.    Her father was Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí Nahrí of Isfahan an eminent Bahá’í of the city and prominent aristocrat.  Fátimih was brought from Persia to Acre, Israel after both Bahá’u’lláh and his wife Navváb expressed an interest in her to marry `Abdu’l-Bahá.      After a wearisome journey from Isfahán to Akka she finally arrived accompanied by her brother in 1872.   The young couple were betrothed for about five months before the marriage itself commenced. In the mean time, Fátimih lived in the home of `Abdul-Bahá’s uncle Mírzá Músá. According to her later memoirs, Fátimih fell in love with `Abdul-Bahá on seeing him. `Abdul-Bahá himself had showed little inkling to marriage until meeting Fátimih;  who was entitled Munírih by Bahá’u’lláh.  Munírih is a title meaning "Luminous".    The marriage resulted in nine children. The first born was a son Mihdí Effendi who died aged about 3. He was followed by Ḍiyáiyyih  Kh ánum, Fu’ádíyyih  Kh ánum (d. few years old), Rúhangíz Khánum (d. 1893), Túbá Khánum, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), Túbá  Kh ánum, Rúhá  Kh ánum and Munnavar  Kh ánum. The death of his children caused `Abdu’l-Bahá immense grief – in particular the death of his son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle.  The surviving children (all daughters) were; Ḍiyáiyyih  Kh ánum (mother of Shoghi Effendi) (d. 1951) Túbá  Kh ánum (1880–1959) Rúḥá  Kh ánum and Munavvar  Kh ánum (d. 1971).  Baháulláh wished that the Baháís follow the example of `Abdul-Bahá and gradually move away from polygamy.    The marriage of `Abdu’l-Bahá to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous,  from advice of his father and his own wish,   legitimised the practice of monogamy  to a people whom hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.    Will and Muhammad `Alí, was mentioned by name as being subordinate to `Abdul-Bahá. Muhammad `Alí became jealous of his half-brother and set out to establish authority for himself as an alternative leader with the support of his brothers Badiullah and Diyaullah.  He began correspondence with Baháís in Iran, initially in secret, casting doubts in others minds about `Abdul-Bahá.    While most Baháís followed `Abdul-Bahá, a handful followed Muhammad `Alí including such leaders as Mirza Javad and Ibrahim Khayrullah, the famous Baháí missionary to America.

By 1902, however, due to the Governor of `Akka being supportive of `Abdul-Bahá, the situation was greatly eased; while pilgrims were able to once again visit `Abdul-Bahá, he was confined to the city.  In February 1903, two followers of Muhammad `Alí, including Badiullah and Siyyid `Aliy-i-Afnan, broke with Muhammad `Ali and wrote books and letters giving details of Muhammad `Alis plots and noting that what was circulating about `Abdul-Bahá was fabrication.    From 1902 to 1904, in addition to the building of the Shrine of the Báb that `Abdul-Bahá was directing, he started to put into execution two different projects; the restoration of the House of the Báb in Shiraz, Iran and the construction of the first Baháí House of Worship in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.     `Abdul-Bahá asked Aqa Mirza Aqa to coordinate the work so that the house of the Báb would be restored to the state that it was at the time of the Bábs declaration to Mulla Husayn in 1844;   he also entrusted the work on the House of Worship to Vakil-ud-Dawlih.   Also in 1904, Muhammad `Ali continued his accusations against `Abdul-Bahá which caused an Ottoman commission summoning `Abdul-Bahá to answer the accusations levelled against him. During the inquiry the charges against him were dropped and the inquiry collapsed.     The next few years in `Akka were relatively free of pressures and pilgrims were able to come and visit `Abdul-Bahá.  By 1909 the mausoleum of the Shrine of the Báb was completed.     to live in Haifa near the Shrine of the Báb.  In 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three year journey to Egypt, Europe, and North America, spreading the Baháí message. From August to December 1911, `Abdul-Bahá visited cities in Europe, including London, Bristol, and Paris.

He also insisted that all his meetings be open to all races.    La Presse among others reported on `Abdul-Bahás activities.       The headlines in those papers included "Persian Teacher to Preach Peace", "Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices",  and "Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Bahas Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth."   The Montreal Standard, which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreals largest French language newspaper published two articles about him.  His 1912 visit to Montreal also inspired humourist Stephen Leacock to parody him in his bestselling 1914 book Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich.  In Chicago one newspaper headline included "His Holiness Visits Us, Not Pius X but A. Baha,"  and `Abdul-Bahás visit to California was reported in the Palo Altan.   Back in Europe, he visited London, Paris (where he stayed for two months), Stuttgart, Budapest, and Vienna. Finally on 12 June 1913 he returned to Egypt, where he stayed for six months before returning to Haifa.  During World War I `Abdul-Bahá stayed in Palestine, under the continued threat of Allied bombardment and threats from the Turkish commander. As the war ended, the British Mandate over Palestine brought relative security to `Abdul-Bahá. During his final year, a growing number of visitors and pilgrims came to see him in Haifa.   On 27 April 1920, he was awarded a knighthood (Order of the British Empire|KBE) by the British Mandate of Palestine for his humanitarian efforts during the war.  `Abdul-Bahá died on 28 November 1921 (27th of Rabi al-awwal|Rabiul-Avval, 1340 AH.)
