Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery" but mainly due to land title difficulties. Sandburg (1926), p. 20.  In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of milk sickness in 1818.   After the death of Lincolns mother, his older sister, Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah, took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son.  Sarah Bush Johnston, the mother of three of her own children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as "Mother".   As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy.   As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, "the Clarys Grove boys".   Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21. Donald (1996), pp. 30â€“33.  In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money.  Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his fathers lack of education.  While young Lincolns formal elementary education consisted approximately of a years worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader.  Macon County, new homestead Coles County, New Salem Sangamon County.  In the spring of 1831, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleansâ€”and witnessing slavery firsthandâ€”he walked back home. == Lincolns first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died, however, on August 25, most likely of typhoid fever.  In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship was over.  Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington, Kentucky.  They met in Springfield, Illinois|Springfield, Illinois, in December 1839 Sandburg (1926), pp. 46â€“48.  and were engaged the following December. A wedding set for January 1, 1841 was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincolns initiative.   They later met at a party and were married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Marys married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling reluctance again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose."  Thomas "Tad" Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853 and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. The death of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.  Abraham Lincoln suffered from "melancholy", a condition which now may be referred to as clinical depression.   Lincolns father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.  He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.  New Salem, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.  Before the election Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War.  Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly.  At  ,  he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him.  Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.  Admitted to William Herndon, whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man".  He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County. In the 1835â€“1836 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not.  He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils."  He closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa.  Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be, "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay".  The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.  President Polks desire for "military gloryâ€”that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood".  Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico. Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the US; Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil".  Basler (1946), pp. 199â€“202.  Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.  Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln". McGovern, p. 33.     Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.  1848 presidential election.  Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, Justin Butterfield, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincolns view, an "old fossil".  The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.   a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.   Alton & Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.  Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.  From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincolns largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincolns most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William "Duff" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. Donald (1996), pp. 150â€“151.  The case is famous for Lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.  Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judges decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.  ==  popular sovereignty republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.  . Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford as a conspiracy.]] Peoria Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.  Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,  he said the Kansas Act had a "declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world..." In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.  After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull, who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson.  The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery." Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil, Liberty, and Democratic party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party.  At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the partys candidate for vice president. In 1857â€“58, Douglas broke with President James Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state.  In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford; Chief Justice Roger B. Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution.  Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power   Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity, but they did consider all men created equalâ€”equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  House Divided Speech, drawing on Marks gospel from the Bible: "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolvedâ€”I do not expect the house to fallâ€”but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.  The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. == The 1858 senate campaign featured the seven Lincolnâ€“Douglas debates of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history.  The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that "The Slave Power" was threatening the values of Republicanism in the United States|republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.  The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglass popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nations morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.  In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the states 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.  speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong".  Despite his inelegant appearanceâ€”many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly â€”Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist Noah Brooks reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience."   Donald described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rivals (William H. Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rivals (Salmon P. Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery."  In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste is in my mouth a little." ==   Norman Judd, Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincolns friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincolns success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.  On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top.  Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.  Lincolns managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincolns strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".  Democratic convention, disagreeing with Douglass position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials.  There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincolns life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  The Republican Partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincolns life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.  == On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and   in which all of Lincolns opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College. As Lincolns election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March.  On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.   Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America. Donald (1996), p. 267.  The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.  President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.  The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as their provisional President on February 9, 1861. There were attempts at compromise. The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Partys free-soil platform. White, pp. 360â€“361.  Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right."  Lincoln, however, did support the Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had passed in Congress and protected slavery in those states where it already existed.  A few weeks before the war, he went so far as to pen a letter to every governor asking for their support in ratifying the Corwin Amendment as a means to avoid secession.  evaded possible inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states: The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."  The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was implausible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. ==   Major Robert Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war.  Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln miscalculated in believing that he could preserve the Union,  and William Tecumseh Sherman, then a civilian, visited Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at Lincolns seeming failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war.  Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."  Richmond so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral. Oates, p. 226.  attacked Union habeas corpus.  John Merryman, a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus, saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merrymans release, but Lincoln ignored it.  Then and throughout the war Lincoln came under heavy, often vituperative attack from antiwar Democrats, called Copperheads. == Fort Sumter, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion.  Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.   Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy In late August 1861, General John C. FrÃ©mont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting Washington, a proclamation of martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. FrÃ©mont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled FrÃ©monts proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremonts emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal.  Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops. The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship the Trent on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain. Adams, pp. 540â€“562.   Lincolns foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Sewards initial reaction to the Trent affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy. To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied  , a student of the European strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini, of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River;  and he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg, and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army, rather than simply capturing territory. ==After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies.  McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaigns objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellans repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellans troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.   John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincolns strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.  The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellans failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.  Two days after McClellans return to command, General Robert E. Lees forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862.  The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January.  Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.  McClellan then resisted the Presidents demand that he pursue Lees retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander in Chief.  Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.  Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his history of loose talk about a military dictatorship.  the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress". In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about a group of upcoming battle plans, to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hookers attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grants on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston. Lincoln   became despondenTroops headed south towards Waeast initially, succeeded. Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May,  but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincolns order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harpers Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lees army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander in Chief. ==  Founding Fathers, under the constitution.    President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. FrÃ©mont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.   in 1864|alt=A dark-haired, bearded, middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men.]] Confiscation Act, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congresss power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the commander-in-chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free." Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the war could not be won without freeing the slaves. However Confederate and anti-war propagandists had success spreading the theme that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy.  and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union: Lincoln had over and over again made clear that he wanted the states to emancipate the slaves (which they officially did in 1865 by ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment). His role in leading the national army would be to save the union, using every tool available, including complete or partial emancipation (he employed partial emancipation).  As for the Confederates, they would return only at the point of a bayonet.  colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.  A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors Conference; they supported the presidents Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army. Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. At first, Lincoln was reluctant to fully implement this program, but by the spring of 1863, he was ready to initiate "a massive recruitment of Negro troops". In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once".  By the end of 1863, at Lincolns direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.  Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color". == With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery.  Defying Lincolns prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here," the Address became the most quoted speech in American history. The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born, not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."   He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort.  He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objectiveâ€”a new birth of freedom in the nation.  ==  in March, 1865]]Meades failure to capture Lees army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General Ulysses S. Grants victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I cant spare this man. He fights."  With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops. Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grants political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grants promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congresss consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.  war of Cold Harbor. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces".  The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grants plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer." The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lees army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside Petersburg, Virginia, where Grant began a siege. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grants headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.    Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced his losses. Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructureâ€”such as plantations, railroads, and bridgesâ€”hoping to destroy the Souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grants move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginias Shenandoah Valley. The damage caused by Shermans March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a   swath but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in "total war" against civilians, as in World War II.  raid on Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!"  After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.  Stephens led Appomattox and the war was effectively over. ==  Union Party. When Grants spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the Presidents re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:   Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. Peace wing David Farraguts capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters;  the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.  Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers vote.  second inaugural address. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be Gods will. Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world".  Lincoln said: ==  Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincolns Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Lincolns appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taneys seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.  Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865. As the war drew to a close, Lincolns presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen.  He signed into law Senator Charles Sumners Freedmans Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen.  Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction.  Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists. == The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.    republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political valuesâ€”what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.  The Declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitutions tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.  Burton (2008) argues that Lincolns republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.   First Inaugural Address, Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."  ==Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.  He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869.  The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.   Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. In 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax.  This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800, which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.  Department of Sioux Uprising" Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).   President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy. In the wake of Grants casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincolns reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.  Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Donald (1996), p. 471.  Before Lincolns presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had only been proclaimed by the federal government sporadically, and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madisons presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.  In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park. == David Davis, Lincolns campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincolns Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincolns Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party. ==West Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted October 31, 1864. Lincoln recognized both of these state governments when formed locally, but was not otherwise involved prior to their admission by Congress.      After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.  Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending Fords Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State William H. Seward and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play. Lincolns bodyguard, John Parker, left Fords Theater during intermission to join Lincolns coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13&nbsp;pm, aimed at the back of Lincolns head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but Booth stabbed him and escaped.  After being on the run for 10 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some   south of Washington D.C. After a brief fight, Booth was killed by Union soldiers on April 26. An Army surgeon, Doctor  , then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages." Lincolns flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the citys church bells rang. Vice President Johnson was sworn in as President at 10:00&nbsp;am the day after the assassination. Lincoln lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 â€“ April 21.  For three weeks his funeral train brought the body to cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing.     in 1869]]Scholars  have extensively written on topics concerning Lincolns beliefs and philosophy; e.g. whether Lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language reflected his own personal beliefs or was a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants.  Though he never joined a church, Lincoln was familiar with the Bible, quoted it and praised it. In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.   Some scholars  maintain that in the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; instead, they  argue, he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. Some historians  also conclude that when he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God. As Lincoln grew older, it may be that the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs increasingly influenced his beliefs and public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.  After Willies death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln apparently attempted to put on paper his private thoughts on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds."   In April 1864, discussing Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it." Donald (1996), p. 514.  surveys of scholars ranking Presidents since the 1940s, Lincoln is typically ranked in the top three, often #1.  A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. Taranto, p. 264.  President Lincolns assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion.  Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincolns name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.   focuses on Lincoln scholarship and popular interpretation]]Schwartz argues that Lincolns reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900-1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington.   In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincolns image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.  political conservatives agrarian Democrats.  William C. Harris found that Lincolns "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism.".   James G. Randall  emphasizes his tolerance and his especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform." Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called radicalism which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."  Lerone Bennett sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians;  and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.   The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.    Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincolns image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule," in the late 20th century.  Whereas, Donald in his 1996 biography opined that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason."    capital of City Hall Birthplace National Boyhood National Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois  commemorate the president.  Library and Museum, located in Springfield.   The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois, contains his remains and those of his wife Mary and three of his four sons, Edward, William, and Thomas. Within a year of this death, his image began to be disseminated throughout the world on stamps,   and he is the only U.S. President to appear on a  .   Currency honoring the president includes the United States United States five-dollar bill|five-dollar bill and the Lincoln cent, which represents the first regularly circulating U.S. coin to feature an actual person.   Presidents Day Bicentennial Commission to commemorate his 200th birthday in February 2009. Lincoln sites remain popular tourist attractions, but crowds have thinned. In the late 1960s, 650,000 people a year visited the home in Springfield, slipping to 393,000 in 2000â€“2003. Likewise visits to New Salem fell by half, probably because of the enormous draw of the new museum in Springfield. Visits to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington peaked at 4.3&nbsp;million in 1987 and have since declined. However crowds at Fords Theatre in Washington have grown sharply.   == *  * * * * *   * *  *  * *  *  *  * *  * *  * * * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  *   *  *  *  * *  * *  *  *  * *  *    *  *  , also published as vol 3â€“4 of Ordeal of the Union*  ; also published as vol 5â€“8 of Ordeal of the Union*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * * *  *  *  * *  * * *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  ==* * * *<!--       | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
