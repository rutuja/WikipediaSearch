It is the seat of the Ostalbkreis district, and its largest city, as well as the largest city within the Ostwürttemberg region. In spatial planning, Aalen is designated a Mittelzentrum (“medium-level centre”). Since 1 April 1956, Aalen has the status of Große Kreisstadt (“major district town”). Government Region of Stuttgart, after Stuttgart. With a population of about 66,000, Aalen is on position 15 within Baden-Württemberg.== Aalen is situated on the upper reaches of the river Kocher, at the foot of the Swabian Jura to the south and south-east and close to the hilly landscape of the Ellwanger Berge to the north.In terms of natural regions, the west of Aalen’s territory is on the foreland of the eastern Swabian Jura, and the north and north-west is on the Swabian-Franconian Uplands, both being part of the Swabian Keuper-Lias Plains. The south-west is part of the Albuch, the east is part of the Härtsfeld, these two both being parts of the Swabian Jura. The Kocher enters the city’s territory from Oberkochen on the south, crosses the city district of Unterkochen, then the city centre, where the Aal flows into it. The Aal is a small river stretching only on the towns territory. Next, the Kocher crosses the city district of Wasseralfingen, then leaves the city for Hüttlingen, Baden-Württemberg|Hüttlingen.  Rivers originating near Aalen are the Rems (near Essingen, west of Aalen) and the Jagst (near Unterschneidheim, east of Aalen), both being subsidiaries of the Neckar, just like the Kocher. Lein river near Rodamsdörfle, the highest point is the Grünberg’s peak near Unterkochen at 733&amp;nbsp;m. == lithostratigraphic groups of the south-German Jurassic: Aalen’s south and the Flexner massif are on top of the Weißer Jura (White Jurassic), the city center is on the Brauner Jura (Brown Jurassic), and a part of Wasseralfingen is on the Schwarzer Jura (Black Jurassic). Therefore, the city advertises itself as a “Geologist’s Mecca”.  Most part of the territory is on the Opalinuston-Formation (Opalinum Clay Formation (stratigraphy)|Formation) of the Aalenian subdivision, which is named after Aalen. On the Sandberg, the Schnaitberg and the Schradenberg hills, all in the west of Aalen, the Eisensandstein (Iron Sandstone) Formation emerges to surface. On the other hills of the city, sands (Goldshöfer Sande), gravel and residual rubble prevail. holocenic floodplain loam (Auelehm) and riverbed gravel that have filled in the valley.Most parts of Dewangen and Fachsenfeld are founded on formations of Jurensismergel (Jurensis Marl), Posidonienschiefer (cf. Posidonia Shale), Amaltheenton (Amalthean Clay), Numismalismergel (Numismalis Marl) and Obtususton (Obtusus Clay, named after Asteroceras obtusum) succeeding from south to north, all belonging to the Jurassic. They are at last succeeded by the Trossingen Formation already belonging to the Late Triassic. Tiefer Stollen section).==The maximum extent of the city’s territory amounts to   in north-south dimension and   in east-west dimension. The area is 14,662.8 hectares, which includes 42.2 % (6,186.2 hectares) agriculturally used area and 37.7 % (5,534.9 hectares) of forest. 11.5 % (1,692.3 hectares) are built up or vacant, 6.4 % (932.8 hectares) is used by traffic infrastructure. Sporting and recreation grounds and parks comprise 1 % (152.7 hectares), other areas 1.1 % (163.9 hectares). Statistisches Jahrbuch der Stadt Aalen 2007/2008. == municipalities border on Aalen.

So Aalen is above the German average of 1550 hours per year. However, with 167 days of precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation, Aalen’s region also ranks above the German average of 138. The annual rainfall is 807 millimetres, which puts Aalen into the moderate middle within Baden-Württemberg. Mean fluctuations in temperature of up to -11.6&amp;nbsp;°C in January and 32.7&amp;nbsp;°C in July result in an annual mean temperature of 9.9&amp;nbsp;°C. Here Aalen as well ranks above the German average of 8.2&amp;nbsp;°C and the Baden-Württemberg average of 8.1&amp;nbsp;°C.== First settlements  tumuli of the Hallstatt culture were found. In Aalen and Wasseralfingen, Golden and silver coins left by the Celts were found, who also fortified the Schloßbaufeld settlement with sectional embankments and a stone wall. Near Heisenberg (Wasseralfingen), a celtic nemeton is situated.  Roman era  Around 150   is not detectable.  Foundation of the city Archeologists regard findings of alamannic graves originating from the 7th century as the root of the village of Aalen. In the northern and western walls of St. John’s church, which is located directly adjacent to the eastern gate of the Roman fort, Roman stones were incorporated. The building existing today probably dates to the 9th century.In the Middle Ages, the first time a place today being part of Aalen was mentioned was 839, when emperor Louis the Pious permitted the Fulda monastery to exchange estate in the Hammerstadt village, then known as Hamarstat.   Aalen itself was first mentioned in an inventory list of Ellwangen Abbey, dated ca. 1136, as the village Alon, along with a lower nobleman named Conrad of Aalen. This gender probably had its ancestral castle at a site south of today’s city centre and were probably first subject to Ellwangen abbey, later to the House of Hohenstaufen, and at last to the House of Oettingen. 1426 was the last time a member of that house was attested in connection with Aalen.Middle-aged documents indicate that the city of Aalen was founded by the Hohenstaufen between 1241 and 1246, but at a different site than the like-named village, which is supposed destroyed in 1388 in the course of the war between the Alliance of Swabian Cities and the Dukes of Bavaria.Later, the counts of Oettingen were rulers of the city, which is attested for the first time for 1340. Eberhard II and thus to the House of Württemberg in 1358 or 1359 in exchange for an amount of money.  Imperial city = Designation as Imperial City = Charles IV Imperial City, a city responsible only to the emperor (often misreferred to as Imperial Free City), a title it kept until 1803. In 1377, Aalen joined the Alliance of Swabian Cities. 1385, for the first time the term civitas appeared in the city’s seal. 1398, it was granted the right to hold markets, in 1401 a proper jurisdiction. However, Aalen could not acquire a large territory, it consisted only of the city itself and a few villages. The oldest preserved city view was made in 1528. It was made as the basis of a lawsuit of the city versus the Counts of Oettingen at the   Gate in the east, and St. Martin’s gate in the south. Due to frequent floods, St. Martin’s gate was bricked up in the 14th century and replaced by the Lower or Schwäbisch Gmünd|Gmünd Gate built in the west before 1400. Later, several minor side gates were build. The central street market took place on the Wettegasse (today called Marktplatz, “market square”) and the Reichsstädter Straße. So the market course was, as usual by then, from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was bent L-like between southern (St. Martin’s) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.Around 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the city church to St. John’s Church.  In 1514, the Vierundzwanziger (“Group of 24”) was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.= Reformation = Louis III, right of patronage in Aalen, were able to temporarily restitute Catholicism in Aalen.After military successes of the Protestant Union, protestant church practices were instituted again.= City fire of 1634 = Battle of city fire. About its extent, differing evaluations exist. According to 17th century accounts, the church and all the city’s buildings, except of the Schwörturm tower, were casualties of the fire, and only nine families survived. 19th century research by Hermann Bauer, Lutheran pastor and local historian, evaluated this as not coherent and exaggerated, but it is beyond question that the city church and buildings in a “rather large” circumcircle around it were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the city archive accommodated in an addition to the church, with all of its documents.  After the fire, soldiers of both armies went through the city looting.  It took nearly 100 years for the city to re-approach its population of 2,000.French troops traversed Aalen in 1688 in the course of the Nine Years War, however, unlike at other places, without leaving severe damages. The French pulled through again in 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession and in 1741 during the War of the Austrian Succession,  the latter also caused imperial troops to traverse in 1743. The City Church’s tower collapsed in 1765, presumably because statics was not taken into account well enough at the reconstruction after the city fire of 1634. The collapsing tower struck two children of the tower watchman who died of their injuries, and destroyed the nave, leaving only the altar cross intact. The remaining walls had to be knocked down due to the great damage. Reconstruction began the same year, creating the building still existing today. On 22 November 1749, in Aalen, being an imperial and thus neutral city, the Aalen protocol was signed by the Duchy of Württemberg and the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen, regulating cohabitation of Lutherans and Roman Catholics in the jointly ruled place of Oberkochen.= Napoleonic era =  electorate of Württemberg (later to become the Kingdom of Württemberg) and became seat of the District (“Oberamt”) of Aalen. During the War of the Third Coalition, on 6 October 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte arrived in Aalen, carrying along an army of 40,000. This event, along with Bavarian and Austrian troops moving in some days later, caused miseries that according to the city clerk “no feather could describe”. In 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of Wöllwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.In the age of the Napoleonic wars, the city walls were no longer of use. In the 18th century, the maintenance of walls, gates and towers was neglected more and more, so ever more components of the wall went into a state of disrepair. For thorough repairs, funds were lacking, not at least in the face of the enormous war expenditures. Starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon, so the fortifications today are nearly completely vanished.  Industrial revolution   weaving mills, which produced linen and woolen goods, and baking of sweet pastry and gingerbread.  In Aalen, industrialisation became noticeable only slowly. A first peak were the 1840s, when three factories for   was opened and gas lighting was introduced. In 1870, a modern water supply system was started and in 1912 the mains electricity. In 1935 at last, the first electrically powered street lights were installed.  To fight housing shortage during and after World War I, the city set up the barracks settlement areas at the Schlauch and Alter Turnplatz grounds. In spite of the industry being crippled by the Great Depression of 1929, the public baths at the Hirschbach creek where modernized, extended and re-opened in 1931.  Nazi era  federal election Centre Party March 1933 federal elections, this setting had changed: The Nazi Party resulted still below German average with 34.1 % (43.9 % nation-wide), but became the by far strongest party in Aalen, followed by the Centre party unaltered at 26.6 % (11.3 %) and the Social Democrats (18.6 %/18.3 %).  Nazi rule military district riding and driving school was deployed in Aalen, as well as an army replenishment office (Heeresverpflegungsamt), a branch arsenal office (Heeresnebenzeugamt) and a branch army ammunitions institute (Heeresnebenmunitionsanstalt). mergers of Landkreis of Aalen and the municipality of Unterrombach was disbanded. Its territory was mostly added to Aalen, with the exception of Hammerstadt, which was added to the municipality of Dewangen. Forst, Rauental and Vogelsang were added to Essingen (in 1952 the entire former municipality of Unterrombach was merged into Aalen, with the exception of Forst, which is part of Essingen until present). concentration camp, subcamp of forced labor in industrial businesses nearby. Until the camp’s dissolution in February 1945, 60 prisoners died.  Between 1946 and 1957, the camp buildings were torn down, its foundations are still in place in house Moltkestraße 44/46. Besides, several labour camps existed where prisoners of war and women and men from countries occupied by Germany were pooled, who had to work for the arms industry in major businesses like Schwäbische Hüttenwerke and the Alfing Keßler machine factory.  air warfare, which led to destruction and severe damage of parts of the city, the train station and other railway installations. A series of air attacks lasting for more than three weeks had its peak on 17 April 1945, when United States Army Air Forces planes bombed the branch arsenal office and the train station. 59 people were killed, more than half of them buried by debris, and more than 500 lost their homes.  33&amp;nbsp;residential buildings, 12&amp;nbsp;other buildings and 2&amp;nbsp;bridges were destroyed; 163&amp;nbsp;buildings, including 2&amp;nbsp;churches, were damaged.  Five days later, the Nazi rulers of Aalen were unseated by the US forces. Post-war era  see below).The population of Aalen exceeded the limit of 20,000, the requirement for the status of Große Kreisstadt (“major district town“) in 1946. On 1 August 1947, Aalen was declared Unmittelbare Kreisstadt (“immediate district town”), and with the coming into effect of the Gemeindeordnung (municipal code) of Baden-Württemberg on 1 April 1956, it was declared Große Kreisstadt.==On 31&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;2008, 51.1&amp;nbsp;percent of the entire city’s inhabitants were members of the Catholic Church, 23.9&amp;nbsp;percent were members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|Evangelical-Lutheran Church. About 25&amp;nbsp;percent belong to other or no religious community or gave no information.  The city district of Waldhausen was the district with the highest percentage of Roman Catholic inhabitants 75.6&amp;nbsp;percent, the central district was the one with the highest percentage of Evangelical-Lutheran inhabitants (25.6&amp;nbsp;percent) as well as those adhering to other or no religious communities (32.5&amp;nbsp;percent).  Protestantism Aalen’s population originally was subject to the jus patronatus of Ellwangen Abbey, and thus subject to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg. reformation section). Being an Imperial City, Aalen could govern its clerical matters on its own. Clerics, organists and choir masters were direct subjects to the city council, which thus exerted bishop-like power; even a proper hymn book for Aalen did exist.  After the transition to Württemberg in 1803, Aalen became seat of a deanery, with the dean church being the City Church (with the building of constructed from 1765 to 1767, existing until present). Another utilized church is John the Baptist|St. John’s Church, located on the cemetery, refurbished in 1561. Old Pietistic communities. Catholicism  The few Catholics of todays central district were covered by the parish of Unterkochen until the 19th century, a situation which continued for some years even after completion of Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Marys Church in 1868 constructed by Georg Morlok.  However, in 1872 Aalen got its proper parish again, and in 1913, a second Catholic church was completed, Salvator’s Church, and in 1969 the Holy Cross Church. In 1963, a second parish had already been set up, which in 1972 got a new Church, the new St. Mary’s Church, which has been erected in place of the old St. Mary’s church, which had been torn down in 1968. Another church of the second parish was St. Augustine’s Church, completed in 1970. In 1976 and 1988 at last, St. Elizabeth’s Church resp. St. Thomas’ Church were completed. Furthermore, in 1963 the St. Michael pastoral care office is existing since 1963. early Gothic tower and a new-build nave of 1875. Today’s building of the Immaculate Conception|Mary’s Immaculate Conception Church in Ebnat was constructed in 1723, but the church was first mentioned in 1298. Hofen’s Saint George’s Church is a fortified church, whose present nave was built from 1762 to 1775. Beside the church, the Late Gothic Odile of Alsace|St. Odile’s Chapel is standing, whose entrance has the year 1462 engraved. Foundations of predecessor buildings were dated to the 11th and 13th century.  Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, but these some of these units also comprise some parishes outside of Aalen. Pastoral Care Unit two comprises the parishes of Essingen, Dewangen and Fachsenfeld, unit four comprises Hofen and Wasseralfingen, unit five comprises both parishes of Aalen’s centre and Hofherrnweiler, unit five comprises Waldhausen, Ebnat, Oberkochen and Unterkochen. Other christian communities Besides the two major christian denominations, in Aalen there are also free churches and other communities, including the United Methodist Church, the Baptists, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the New Apostolic Church. Other religions Until the late 19th century, no Jews are testified in Aalen. It was not before 1886 that four Jews were living in Aalen, a number that rose to ten in 1900, fell to seven in 1905, and remained so until 1925. Upon the Nazis’ rise to power in 1933, seven Jews, including two children, lived in Aalen.  During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the vitrines of the three Jewish shops in the city were smashed and their proprietors imprisoned for several weeks. After their release, most Aalen Jews emigrated. The last Jew of Aalen, Fanny Kahn, was forcibly resettled to Oberdorf am Ipf, which had a large Jewish community. Today, a street of Aalen is named after her. The Jew Max Pfeffer returned from Brussels to Aalen in 1948 to continue his shop, but emigrated to Italy in 1967.  Ditib community, Fatih Mosque, as well at Ulmer Straße.  Mergings Today’s city of Aalen was formed on 21 June 1975 by unification of the cities of Aalen and Wasseralfingen, with the initial name of Aalen-Wasseralfingen, with a territory one third larger than Aalen’s prior territory.  Already on 1 July 1975, it was renamed to Aalen. Before, the former city of Aalen had already merged the following municipalities:* 1938: Unterrombach* 1 January 1970: Waldhausen* 1 July 1972: Ebnat* 1 January 1973: Dewangen, Fachsenfeld (including the village of Hangendenbach, which was transferred from Abtsgmünd in 1954) and Unterkochen. The merging of Dewangen nearly doubled the territory of Aalen.== During the Middle Ages and the early modern period, Aalen was just a small city with a few hundred inhabitants. The population grew slowly and doubled back over and again due to numerous wars, famines and epidemics. It was the beginning of the industrialisation in the 19th century that accelerated growth. While in 1803, only 1,932 inhabited the city, in 1905 it were already 10,442. The number continued to rise and amounted to 15.890 in 1939. ethnic Germans Statistical Office main domiciles).The following overview shows the population figures of the city territory of the respective year. Until 1823, the figures are mostly estimates, thereafter census results or official updates by the state statistical office. Until 1871, the figures were determined by non-uniform elicitation methods, since 1871 they refer to the “population present at the place”, since 1925 to the resident population and since 1987 to the “population at the place of main domicile”.{|| valign="top" |{| class="wikitable"|-!
