Adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. In hot climates, compared with wooden buildings, adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass, but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage.  Andean region of South America for several thousand years, although often substantial amounts of stone are used in the walls of Pueblo buildings.  (Also, the Pueblo people built their adobe structures with handfuls or basketfuls of adobe, until the Spanish introduced them to the making of bricks.) Adobe brickmaking was used in Spain already in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age, from the eighth century B.C. on.  Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and make, and the economy of creating it. A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes, which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger adobines, some of which may be one to two yards (1–2&amp;nbsp;m) long. , Chile]] Coptic (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BC), dj-b-t became tobe "  brick."  This evolved into Arabic al-tub (الطّوب al "the" + tub "brick") "  brick," which was assimilated into Old Spanish as adobe  , still with the meaning "mud brick."  English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century. ]]In more modern English usage, the term "adobe" has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America, especially in New Mexico.  (Compare with stucco). Dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects.   The mixture is roughly half sand (50%), one-third clay (35%), and one-sixth straw (15%) by weight. , Kyrgyzstan]]Bricks are made in an open frame,   by   being a reasonable size, but any convenient size is acceptable. The mixture is molded by the frame, and then the frame is removed quickly. After drying a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying.  Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.The same mixture to make bricks, without the straw, is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.  The brick’s thickness is preferred partially due to its thermal characteristics, and partially due to the stability of a thicker brick versus a more standard-sized brick.  Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying time is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks.  Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, rebar or wooden posts.  Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.  A general testing is done on the soil content first.  To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid.  After it is sealed, the container is shaken vigorously for at least one minute.  It is then allowed to sit on a flat surface for a day or so until the soil has settled into layers or remains in suspension. Heavier particles settle out first, so gravel will be on the bottom, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The New Mexico US Extension Service recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.The largest structure ever made from adobe (bricks) was the Bam Citadel, which suffered serious damage (up to 80%) by an earthquake on December 26, 2003. Other large adobe structures are the Huaca del Sol in Peru, with 100 million signed bricks, the ciudellas of Chan Chan and Tambo Colorado, both in Peru (in South America). passive solar home, this is called a Trombe wall.    course is laid the whole length of the wall, overlapping at the corners on a layer of adobe mortar.  Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories because they are load bearing and have low structural strength.  When placing window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above.  Within the last courses of brick, bond beams are laid across the top of the bricks to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof to distribute the weight more evenly along the wall.  To protect the interior and exterior adobe wall, finishes can be applied, such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco.  These finishes protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically, or the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters providing longer protection.The traditional adobe roof has been generally constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand, and other available organic materials.  The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe. For a deeper understanding of adobe, one might examine a cob building.  Cob (building)|Cob, a close cousin to adobe, contains proportioned amounts of soil, clay, water, manure, and straw.  This is blended, but not formed like adobe.  Cob is spread and piled around a frame and allowed to air dry for several months before habitation.  Adobe, then, can be described as dried bricks of cob, stacked and mortared together with more adobe mixture to create a thick wall and/or roof.==Depending on the materials available, a roof can be assembled using lengths of wood or metal to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been performed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly.  This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent major cracking.== Vigas are beams across the roof that support the roof.==To raise a flattened adobe roof, beams of wood or metal should be assembled and span the extent of the building.  The ends of the beams should then be fixed to the tops of the walls using the builder’s preferred choice of attachments.  Taking into account the material from which the beams and walls are made, choosing the attachments may prove difficult.  A combination of the bricks and adobe mortar that are laid across the beams creates an even load-bearing pressure that can last for many years depending on attrition.Once the beams are laid across the building, it is then time to begin the placing of adobe bricks to create the roof.  An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a larger expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the beams.  This wider shape also provides the future homeowner with thermal protection enough to stabilize an even temperature throughout the year.  Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least an inch thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick’s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during the seasons where the arid climate does produce rain.  ==Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof, which is a valuable attribute when the fireplace is kept lit during the cold nights.  The construction of the chimney can also greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the right materials.  The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls.
