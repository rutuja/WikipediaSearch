While Moses was receiving his education at the Egyptian royal court, and during his exile among the Midianites, Aaron and his sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Land of Goshen|Goshen). There, Aaron gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech, so that when the time came for the demand upon the Pharaoh to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s nabi, or spokesman, to his own people (Exodus 7:1)  and, after their unwillingness to hear, to the Pharaoh himself (Exodus 7:9).  Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200&amp;nbsp;BC.==Descended from Abraham, Isaac, and JacobGreat-grandfather: Levi, third of 12 sons and tribes of IsraelGrandfather: KohathFather: AmramMother: JochebedSister: MiriamBrother: MosesUncles: Izhar, Hebron (Biblical figure)|Hebron, UzzielWife: ElishebaSons: Nadav and Avihu|Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, IthamarGrandson: Phinehas==Aaron’s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the Egyptian royal court on behalf of Moses, who was always the central moving figure. The part played by Aaron in the events that preceded the Exodus was, therefore, ministerial, and not directive. He, along with Moses, performed “signs” before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers (Exodus 4:15–16). rod in order to bring on the first of three plagues (Exodus 7:19, 8:1,12). In the infliction of the remaining plagues, he appears to have acted merely as the attendant of Moses, whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon the Pharaoh and his subjects (Exodus 9:23, 10:13,22). The display of potency from Aarons rod had already been demonstrated in the presence of Pharaohs magicians; when Aarons rod was thrown down to the ground it had turned into a snake,  so Pharaohs magicians performed the same act with their own rods.  However, Aarons snake ate up all the other snakes (Exodus 7:9) proving his rod was victorious. During the journey in the wilderness, Aaron is not always prominent or active; and he sometimes appears guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct. At the battle with Amalek, he is chosen with  , however, was admitted with his leader to the very presence of the Lord, while Aaron and Hur remained below to look after the people (Exodus 24:9-14). It was during the prolonged absence of Moses that Aaron yielded to the clamors of the people, and made a Golden Calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from Egypt (Exodus 32:1-6). (It should be noted that in the account given of the same events, in rabbinic sources (b. Talmud Shabbat 99a; Exodus Rabbah 41) and in the Quran, Aaron is not the idol-maker and upon Moses return begged his pardon as he had felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).) At the intercession of Moses, Aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people (Deuteronomy 9:20, Exodus 32:35), although it was to Aaron’s tribe of Levi that the work of punitive vengeance was committed (Exodus 32:26).== At the time when the tribe of Levi was set apart for the priestly service, Aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood, arrayed in the robes of his office, and instructed in its manifold duties (Exodus 28, Exodus 29).On the very day of his consecration, his sons, Nadab and Abihu, were consumed by fire from the Lord for having offered incense in an unlawful manner (Leviticus 10).Scholarly consensus is that in Aarons high priesthood the sacred writer intended to describe a model, the prototype, so to say, of the Jewish high priest. God, on Mount Sinai instituting a worship, also instituted an order of priests. According to the patriarchal customs, the firstborn son in every family used to perform the functions connected with Gods worship. It might have been expected, consequently, that Reubens family would be chosen by God for the ministry of the new altar. However, according to the biblical narrative it was Aaron who was the object of Gods choice. To what jealousies this gave rise later, has been indicated above. The office of the Aaronites was at first merely to take care of the lamp which was to burn perpetually before the veil of the tabernacle Exodus 27:21. A more formal calling soon followed (Exodus 28:1). Aaron and his sons, distinguished from the commoners by their sacred functions, were also to receive holy garments suitable to their office.   Aaron offered the various sacrifices and performed the many ceremonies of the consecration of the new priests, according to the divine instructions (Exodus 29), and repeated these rites for seven days, during which Aaron and his sons were entirely separated from the rest of the people. When, on the eighth day, the high priest had inaugurated his office of sacrifice by killing the animals, he blessed the people (very likely according to the prescriptions of Numbers 6:24-26),  and, with Moses, entered into the tabernacle to possess it. They "came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude: And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces" (Leviticus 9:23-24). In this way the institution of the Aaronic priesthood was established. ==From the time of the sojourn at Mount Sinai, where he became the anointed priest of Israel, Aaron ceased to be the minister of Moses, his place being taken by Joshua. He is mentioned in association with Miriam in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of Moses as the Lord’s prophet. The presumption of the murmurers was rebuked, and Miriam was smitten with Tzaraath. Aaron entreated Moses to intercede for her, at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising. Aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity; and Miriam, after seven days’ quarantine, was healed and restored to favor (Numbers 12). Micah a prophet in Judaism, mentions Moses, Aaron, and Miriam as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus (a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives).  In the present instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle (Numbers 12:6-8) that Moses was unique among men as the one with whom the Lord spoke face to face. The failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of Miriam and Aaron.The validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of Aaron was attested after the ill-fated rebellion of Korah, who was a first cousin of Aaron. When the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents (Numbers 16:25-35), Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50). Aaronites alone (Numbers 18:1-7). The scene of this enactment is unknown, as is the time mentioned.==Aaron, like Moses, was not permitted to enter Canaan with the others.    The reason alleged is that the two brothers showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people.  The action was construed as displaying a want of deference to the Lord, since they had been commanded to speak to the rock, whereas Moses struck it with the staff, twice (Numbers 20:7-11). Of the death of Aaron we have two accounts.  The principal one gives a detailed statement that soon after the incident at Meribah, Aaron, with his son Eleazar and Moses, ascended Mount Hor.  There Moses stripped Aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to Eleazar.  Aaron died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).  The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where Moses is reported as saying that Aaron died at Moserah and was buried there.  There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31–37 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and Mount Hor. The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.    Thus Aaron, the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out  that it is said fifteen times in the  . בא, 1;  strongly implies this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron’s ministration. ==In fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head (  ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab."  The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israels camp disappeared at Aarons death (see Seder Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a).  The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deutronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aarons death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: "There   died Aaron."   The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and Moses.  When the latter was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one anothers greatness.  When Moses at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron, his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart" ( ).  Indeed, Aaron was to find his reward, says   8:1), and of them it is written: "Behold how good and how pleasant   for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (Psalms 133:1).  Of them it is said: "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed  " (Psalms 85:10); for Moses stood for righteousness, according to Deuteronomy 33:21, and Aaron for peace, according to  . Again, mercy was personified in Aaron, according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7 .   the Shekhinah spake the words: "Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon" ( ) .  == Twelve Tribes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: “Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever.”    icon of Aaron (18th century, Iconostasis of Kizhi monastery, Karelia, Russia).]] type of new dispensation(see the Book of Hebrews). venerated as a saint, with a feast day celebrated on September 4, together with Moses (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, September 4 falls on September 17 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). He is also commemorated, together with other righteous saints from the Old Testament on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before Christmas).

In the Quran God says: Aaron was a gifted speaker.  He was largely responsible with teaching the Israelites the way of worship as it was laid out in the Torah of the time. According to the Quran, Moses prayed to God to grant him his brother Aaron as a helper to be with him in all his tasks ahead. God, in the Quran, says that Moses said: God granted Moses his request and told him that he could take his brother along with him.  God says: Aaron, being a prophetic messenger, was also given the law by God, to preach to the Children of Israel according to the Torah. The Quran mentions the holy scripture as a light and guidance for those who would accept the Message. God says in the Quran:  Exodus to calf out of the peoples gold and jewelry and he made the Israelites succumb to idolatry.Aaron preached with powerful zeal to his people, but they refused to listen to him. It is here that the Quranic narrative of the incident sharply contrasts with the Biblical story, which blames Aaron for making the golden calf. Aaron was overpowered and was threatened with being killed by his people. When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, he blamed Aaron for allowing the Israelites to worship this idol and seized his brother by his beard, but Aaron then gave his explanation, after which Moses prayed to God to forgive both of them. As God says in the Quran: ==Muhammad, in many of his sayings, speaks of Aaron. In the event of the Miraj, his miraculous ascension through the Heavens, Muhammad is said to have encountered Aaron in the fifth heaven.  ,    According to old scholars, including Ibn Hisham, Muhammad, in particular, mentioned the beauty of Aaron when he encountered him in Heaven. Martin Lings, in his biographical Muhammad, speaks of Muhammads wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory: Aaron was also mentioned by Muhammad in likeness to Ali. Muhammad had left Ali to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found Ali a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence. Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the prophet said: "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet.  "== , Jordan.]]According to Islamic tradition the tomb of Aaron is located on Jabal Harun, or Aarons Mountain, near Petra in Jordan.   At 1350 meters above sea-level it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here. A 14th century Jordanian mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.  common ancestry. Lemba (a sub-Saharan tribe) are in fact descended from a group of Jewish priests.The Cohen Modal Haplotype or CMH is found in haplogroup Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J1, which geneticists estimate originated in the Southern Levant (modern day Israel, Jordan; biblical Canaan) or North Africa (Egypt) approximately 10,000–15,000 years ago.  Biblical tradition holds that Abraham and his ancestors, the Semitic tribes, originated from Southern Arabia or East Africa (Genesis 10); Aaron and Moses were 7th generation descendants from Abraham (Exodus 6). An estimated 20% of the modern Jewish community fall into haplogroup J1. The traditional date for Abraham is circa 2200–2000&amp;nbsp;BC. Behar, et al., found Kohanim in a variety of haplogroups (E3b, G2, H, I1b, J, K2, Q, R1a1, R1b), which included those which originated in the Levant (J1, J2) and those from Southern Arabia, East Africa, or another geographic region. Dr. Karl Skorecki,     the founder of CMH, reported during a Conference for Kohanim in Jerusalem 2007,  that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. “Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2 ” said Skorecki. According to the observed mutation rates, certain J2 haplotypes found on FTDNA  database projects share a common ancestor who lived 3100+/-200 years Before Present|BP, as Skorecki revealed to the public.Aaron married  , Ithamar, Nadab and Abihu.  A descendant of Aaron is an Aaronite, or Kohen, meaning Priest.   Any non-Aaronic Levite descended from Levi but not of the priestly division  would be assigned to assist the Levitical priests of the family of Aaron in the care of the tabernacle and later of the temple. Depictions of Aaron within art history are rare.  Other than Aarons inclusion in the crowd of revelers around the   in the wilderness Tabernacle.  The Mola “Aaron” is considered, quite surprisingly, the unique single figure of Aaron to have been painted by a European old master artist, circa 15th–18th centuries (A.Pigler, "Barockthemen" Vol. 1; although unknown to Pigler).  The carefully rendered Judaic iconographic details in the Mola painting are rare and the subject itself may have importance in relationship to mid-17th century Jewish history, characterized by a controversial messianic movement involving a serious contender for a new Messiah, Shabtai Zvi, whose influence was felt in Jewish communities worldwide (Harris Lenowitz, "The Jewish Messiahs").  It is highly probable that the Zvi messianic phenomenon was noted by the Catholic Church as a possible threat to Jesus, their sanctified Messiah. It may be significant to note, in considering the possible influence of the Roman Catholic Church in choices of lay-commissioned religious art during this period and considering as well the importance of Aaron in the Christian tradition, that "Aaron, Holy to the Lord" was originally commissioned along with a now lost pendant of Moses (both from Mola) by the nobel Colonna family, wealthy Catholic art patrons living in Rome (Getty Museum Archives). * Tomb of Aaron* Harun* Kohen* Y-chromosomal Aaron* Moses in rabbinic literature ;Attribution*  *   Aberbach, Moses and Leivy Smolar.
