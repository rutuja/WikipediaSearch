1903 World Series Boston Americans of the American League against the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four.Pittsburgh pitcher Sam Leever injured his shoulder while trap-shooting, so his teammate Deacon Phillippe had to pitch five complete games for Pittsburgh. Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League. Boston pitchers Bill Dinneen and Cy Young led Boston to victory. Exposition Park games, if a batted ball rolled under a rope in the outfield that held spectators back, a "ground-rule triple" would be scored. Seventeen ground-rule triples were hit in the four games played at the Exposition Park. In Game&nbsp;1, Phillippe set a World Series record by striking out ten Boston batters. That record lasted barely one day, as Dinneen struck out eleven Pittsburgh batters in Game&nbsp;2.Honus Wagner, bothered by injuries, batted only 6 for 27 (.222) in the Series and committed six errors.  The shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance.  The following spring, Wagner (who led the league in 1903 in batting average) refused to send his portrait to a "Hall of Fame" for batting champions. "I was too bum last year," he wrote. "I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch?  I would be ashamed to have my picture up now."     Washington Senators in the 1925 World Series, and has happened only ten times in baseball history.  The Pirates repeated this feat in   against the Baltimore Orioles.Much was made of the influence of Bostons "Royal Rooters", who traveled to Pittsburgh and sang their theme song "Tessie" to distract the opposing players (especially Honus Wagner). Boston would end up winning three out of the four games at Pittsburgh.The Pirates benevolent owner Barney Dreyfuss added his share of the gate receipts to the players share, so the losing teams players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning teams.The Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.== Western League, a minor league organization, formed the American League to take advantage of the National Leagues 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight.  Johnson and fellow owners raided the senior circuit and signed away many star players, including Cy Young and Jimmy Collins.  Johnson had a list of 46 National Leaguers he targeted for the American League; by 1902, all but one had made the jump.   The constant raiding, however, scotched the idea of a championship between the two leagues. Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss, whose team ran away with the 1902 National League pennant, was open to a post-season contest and even said he would allow the American League champion to stock his roster with All-Stars.    However, Johnson had spoken of putting a team in Pittsburgh and even attempted to raid the Pirates rosters in August 1902, which soured Dreyfuss.  At the end of the season, though, the Pirates played a group of American League All-Stars in a four-game exhibition series, winning two games to one, with one tie.   National Commission to preside over organized baseball. The following season, the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates had secured their pennants by September. That August, Dreyfuss challenged the American League to an eleven game championship series.  Encouraged by Johnson and National League President Harry Pulliam, Americans owner Henry J. Killilea met with Dreyfuss in Pittsburgh in September and instead agreed to a best-of-nine championship, with the first three games played in Boston, the next four in Pittsburgh, and the remaining two (if necessary) in Boston.  One significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues. In short, it was a voluntary event, a fact which would result in no Series at all for  , and eventually to the formal establishment of the Series as a compulsory event starting in  . The Pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful line-up that included legendary shortstop Honus Wagner, who hit .355 and drove in 101 runs, player-manager Fred Clarke, who hit .351, and Ginger Beaumont, who hit .341 and led the league in hits and runs.  The Pirates pitching was weaker than it had been in previous years but boasted 24-game winner Deacon Phillippe and 25-game winner Sam Leever.   runs scored) was considered excellent.   Although the Pirates had dominated their league for the previous three years, they went into the series riddled with injuries and plagued by bizarre misfortunes.  Otto Krueger, the teams only utility player, was beaned on September 19 and never fully played in the series.  16-game winner Ed Doheny left the team three days later, exhibiting signs of paranoia; he was committed to an insane asylum the following month.    Leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm (which he made worse by entering a trapshooting competition).  Worst of all, Wagner, who had a sore thumb throughout the season, injured his right leg in September and was never 100 percent for the post-season.   Some sources say Boston were heavy underdogs. Boston bookies actually gave even odds to the teams (and only because Dreyfuss and other "sports" were alleged to have bet on Pittsburgh to bring down the odds).    The teams were generally thought to be evenly matched, with the Americans credited with stronger pitching and the Pirates with superior offense and fielding.  The outcome, many believed, hinged on Wagners health.  "If Wagner does not play, bet your money at two to one on Boston," said the Sporting News, "but if he does play, place your money at two to one on Pittsburgh."   | score2=Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 0, Boston Americans â€“ 3| date2=October 2| loc2=Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds| time2=1:47| att2=9,415| ref2=  |work=Retrosheet}} | score3=Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 4, Boston Americans â€“ 2| date3=October 3| loc3=Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds| time3=1:50| att3=18,801| ref3=  |work=Retrosheet}} | score4=Boston Americans â€“ 4, Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 5| date4=October 6 Exposition Park (III)| time4=1:30| att4=7,600| ref4=  |work=Retrosheet}} | score5=Boston Americans â€“ 11, Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 2| date5=October 7| loc5=Exposition Park (III)| time5=2:00| att5=12,322| ref5=  |work=Retrosheet}} | score6=Boston Americans â€“ 6, Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 3| date6=October 8| loc6=Exposition Park (III)| time6=2:02| att6=11,556| ref6=  |work=Retrosheet}} | score7=Boston Americans â€“ 7, Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 3| date7=October 10| loc7=Exposition Park (III)| time7=1:45| att7=17,038| ref7=  |work=Retrosheet}} | score8=Pittsburgh Pirates â€“ 0, Boston Americans â€“ 3| date8=October 13| loc8=Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds| time8=1:35| att8=7,455| ref8=  |work=Retrosheet}} }} ==  Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds in Boston, MassachusettsThe Pirates started Game&nbsp;1 strong, scoring six runs in the first four innings. They extended their lead to 7â€“0 on a solo home run by Jimmy Sebring in the seventh, the first home run in World Series history. Boston tried to mount a comeback in the last three innings, but it was too little, too late, as they ended up losing by a score of 7â€“3 in the first ever World Series game. Both Phillippe and Young threw complete games, with Phillippe striking out ten and Young fanning five, but Young also gave up twice as many hits and allowed three earned runs to Phillippes two.== Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds in Boston, MassachusettsAfter starting out strong in Game&nbsp;1, the Pirates simply shut down offensively, managing to get a meager three hits, all of which were singles. Pirates starter Sam Leever went only one inning and gave up three hits and two runs before being replaced by Bucky Veil in the second inning due to injury, who finished the game for Pittsburgh. Bill Dinneen struck out eleven and pitched a complete game for the Americans, while Patsy Dougherty hit home runs in the first and sixth innings to produce two of the Bostons three runs.== Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds in Boston, MassachusettsDeacon Phillippe, pitching on only one day rest, started Game&nbsp;3 for the Pirates, and did not let them down as he pitched his second complete game victory of the series to put the Pirates up two games to one. == Exposition Park (III) in Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaAfter two days of rest, Deacon Phillippe was ready to pitch his second straight game. He threw his third complete game victory of the series against Bill Dinneen, who was pitching in his second start of the series. However, Phillippes second straight victory was almost not to be, as the Americans, down 5â€“1 in the top of the ninth, staged a rally to bring the game within one. The comeback attempt failed, though, as Phillippe managed to put an end to it and give the Pirates a commanding 3â€“1 series lead.== Exposition Park (III) in Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaGame&nbsp;5 was a pitchers duel for the first five innings, with Bostons Cy Young and Pittsburghs Brickyard Kennedy giving up no runs. That changed at the top of the sixth, however, when the Americans scored a then-record six runs that inning. Young, on the other hand, managed to keep his shutout intact before finally giving up a pair of runs in the bottom of the eighth. He went the distance and struck out four for his first World Series win.== Exposition Park (III) in Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaGame&nbsp;6 featured a rematch between the starters of Game&nbsp;2, Bill Dinneen (Boston) and Sam Leever (Pittsburgh). This time, Leever would pitch the entire game, but despite throwing a complete game he was outmatched by Dinneen, who ended up with his second complete game victory of the series. After losing three of the first four games of the World Series, the underdog Boston Americans had tied the series at three games apiece.== Exposition Park (III) in Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaThe fourth and final game in Pittsburgh saw Deacon Phillippe start his fourth game of the series for Pittsburgh. This time, however, he wouldnt fare as well as he did in his first three starts. Cy Young, pitching in his third start of the series, would face a much more favorable fate, holding the Pirates to only three runs. == Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds in Boston, MassachusettsThe final game of the inaugural World Series started out as an intense pitchers duel, with no runs being scored until the fourth inningâ€”when a Hobe Ferris single scored two runners. Deacon Phillippe started his fifth and final game of the series, while Bill Dinneen started his fourth game of the series. As he did in Game&nbsp;2, Dinneen threw a complete game shutout while striking out seven, leading the Boston Americans to victory, while Phillippe, who also threw a respectable game, just couldnt pitch at Dinneens level due to wearing out his arm in the series (as a result of playing so many games in such a short time span) and gave up three runs in the defeat.  Honus Wagner struck out to end the Series.
