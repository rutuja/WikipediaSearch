In this system, sons are preferred from eldest to youngest, the heirs of a son over the next son, and any son over daughters, but there is no preference among daughters: they or their heirs inherit equally.If the daughter is an only child or her sisters are deceased and have no living issue, she (or her heir) is vested with the title; otherwise, since a peerage cannot be shared nor divided, the dignity goes into abeyance between the sisters or their heirs, and is held by no one.  If through lack of issue, marriage or both, eventually only one person represents the claims of all the sisters, he or she can claim the dignity as a matter of right, and the abeyance is said to be terminated.  On the other hand, the number of prospective heirs can grow quite large, since each share potentially can be divided between daughters. Committee for Privileges.

Restoration in 1660. Most subsequent abeyances (only a few dozen cases)  were settled after a few years, to the benefit of the holder of the family properties; there were two periods in which long-abeyant peerages (in some cases peerages of doubtful reality) were brought back: between 1838 and 1841 and between 1909 and 1921.  Abeyance has never applied to earldoms, and the only baronies have been called out of abeyance.

Abeyance can be used in cases where parties are interested in temporarily settling litigation while still holding the right to seek relief later if necessary.  This may be considered a desirable outcome in cases where the party to the lawsuit is an organization with a transient membership and political perspective.  The use of abeyance in such instances can allow such an organization to settle with the party without officially binding its actions in the future, should a new group of decision makers within the organization choose to pursue taking the dispute to court.For example, abeyance was used as a settlement method in a Canadian lawsuit involving the University of Victoria Students Society (UVSS), the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association|BCCLA, and a campus pro-life to whom the UVSS denied funding to.  The parties agreed to settle the lawsuit by holding the case in abeyance in return for the UVSS temporarily giving resources back to the club.  With this arrangement, the pro-life club held on to its right to immediately reopen the case again should the UVSS deny resources to the club in the future, and the UVSS was able to avoid an expensive legal battle it did not have the will to pursue at the time.  Thus the use of abeyance provided the security of a settlement for the pro-life campus club, while preserving the student societys voting memberships ability to take the matter back to court should they choose in the future to deny resources to the club.   * * George Cokayne|Cokayne, George Edward.
