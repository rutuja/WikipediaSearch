It was discovered in Voyager 2|Voyager&nbsp;2 probe photographs taken in 1979, making it the first natural satellite to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft, rather than through telescopic photography.  It was officially named after the mythological Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea, foster mother of Greek god Zeusâ€”the equivalent of Roman god Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter.  Adrastea is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in  less than the length of that planets day. It orbits at the edge of Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Jupiters Main Ring and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moons physical characteristics outside its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.  David C. Thebe and Metis (moon)|Metis) were observed in the images taken a few weeks earlier by Voyager 1|Voyager&nbsp;1. The Galileo spacecraft|Galileo spacecraft was able to determine the moons shape in 1998, but the images remain poor.  In 1983, Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea, the daughter of Zeus and his lover Ananke (mythology)|Ananke.   (naming the moon) Adrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20&times;16&times;14&nbsp;km across.  This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea,  around 0.86&nbsp;g/cmÂ³,    its mass can be estimated at about 2 &nbsp;kg. Amaltheas density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10â€“15%, and Adrastea may be similar. No surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.  inner Jovian Main Ring.  eccentricity and inclination&mdash;around 0.0015 and 0.03Â°, respectively.  Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter. Due to tidal locking, Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter, this being the lowest energy configuration.  tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amaltheas then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid Roche limit. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit. Adrastea is the largest contributor to material in rings of Jupiter|Jupiters rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Inner satellites of Jupiter|Jupiters four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This is because, due to the satellites low density, their surfaces lie rather close to the edge of their Roche spheres. It seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material, as evidenced by the densest ring (the   Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring,  but in back-scattered light (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrasteas orbit.     by
