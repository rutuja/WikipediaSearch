The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) prepositions.  It is a noun that is having something done to it, usually joined (such as in Latin) with the nominative case, making it an indirect object.The accusative case existed in Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European and is present in some Indo-European languages (including Latin, Sanskrit, Greek language|Greek, German language|German, Polish language|Polish, Swedish language|Swedish, Romanian language|Romanian, Russian language|Russian, Ukrainian language|Ukrainian), in the Uralic languages, in Altaic languages, and in Semitic languages (such as Classical Arabic). Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, have two cases to mark objects, the accusative and the partitive case. In morphosyntactic alignment terms, both perform the accusative function, but the accusative object is Telicity|telic, while the partitive is not. dative forms, objective case" instead (see Declension in English).  Hine, a true accusative masculine third person singular pronoun, is attested in some northern English dialects as late as the 19th century. The   vinítel’nyj, from   vinít’ "to blame".In the sentence I see the car, the noun phrase the car is the direct object of the verb "see". In English, which has mostly lost the case system, the definite article and noun&amp;nbsp;– "the car"&amp;nbsp;– remain in the same form regardless of the grammatical role played by the words. One can correctly use "the car" as the subject of a sentence also: "The car is parked here." morphology of the article or noun changes in some way according to the grammatical role played by the noun in a given sentence. For example, in German language|German, one possible translation of "the car" is der Wagen. This is the form in the nominative case, used for the subject of a sentence. If this article/noun pair is used as the object of a verb, it (usually) changes to the accusative case, which entails an article shift in German&amp;nbsp;– Ich sehe den Wagen. In German, masculine nouns change their definite article from der to den in the accusative case.== Latin In Latin, nouns, adjectives, or pronouns in the accusative case (accusativus) can be used direct object.* to indicate duration of time. E.g., multos annos, "for many years"; ducentos annos, "for 200 years."  This is known as the accusative of duration of time.* to indicate direction towards which.  E.g. domum, "homewards"; Romam, "to Rome" with no preposition needed. This is known as the accusative of place to which, and is equivalent to the lative case found in some other languages.* as the subject of an indirect statement (e.g. Dixit me fuisse saevum, "He said that I had been cruel;" in later Latin works, such as the Vulgate, such a construction is replaced by quod and a regularly structured sentence, having the subject in the nominative: e.g., Dixit quod ego fueram saevus).* with case-specific prepositions such as "per" (through), "ad" (to/toward), and "trans" (across). Ulysses in Ovids Remedium Amoris; note that this is feminine: the masculine form would be me miser um ).For the accusative endings, see Latin declension. German  German uses the accusative to mark direct objects and objects of certain preposition and postposition|prepositions, or adverbs relating to time. The accusative is marked for masculine article (grammar)|articles, pronouns, and adjectives.=German articles=The masculine forms for German articles, e.g., the, a/an, my, etc., change in the accusative case: they always end in -en. The feminine, neutral and plural forms do not change.{| class="wikitable"|-!! Masculine! Feminine! Neuter! Plural|-| Definite article (the)| den| die| das| die|-| Indefinite article (a/an)| einen| eine| ein| |}For example, "Hund" (dog) is a masculine (der) word, so the article changes when used in the accusative case:*Ich habe einen Hund. (lit., I have a dog.) In the sentence "a dog" is in the accusative case as it is the second idea (the Object (grammar)|object) of the sentence.=German pronouns=Some German pronouns also change in the accusative case.=German prepositions=The accusative case is also used after particular German prepositions. These include bis, durch, für, gegen, ohne, um, after which the accusative case is always used, and an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen which can govern either the accusative or the dative. The latter prepositions take the accusative when motion or action is specified (being done into/onto the space), but take the dative when location is specified (being done in/on that space). These prepositions are also used in conjunction with certain verbs, in which case it is the verb in question which governs whether the accusative or dative should be used.=German adjectives=Adjective endings also change in the accusative case. Another factor that determines the endings of adjectives is whether the adjective is being used after a definite article (the), after an indefinite article (a/an) or without any article before the adjective (many green apples).{| class="wikitable"|-!!

Russian In Russian, accusative is used not only to display the direct object of an action, but also to indicate the destination or goal of motion. It is also used with some prepositions. The prepositions в and на can both take accusative in situations where they are indicating the goal of a motion. animate and marker in this case.In fact Russian almost lost the real PIE accusative case, since only singular feminine nouns ending in a have a distinct form. Other words use the genitive case or the nominative case in place of the accusative, depending on their animacy. Armenian  Armenian dialects both have a de facto accusative case, Eastern Armenian uses an accusative marker for transitive verbs Example:գիրք - girkh - book (Nominative) ուսուցիչ - usuchičh - teacher (Nominative)Արամը վերցրեց գիրք ը :  Aramë verchrech girkh ë  Aram took the book.Արամը սիրում է իր ուսուցչ ին :  Aramë sirum ē ir usuchičh in  Aram loves his teacher.== Esperanto Esperanto grammar involves only two cases, a nominative and an accusative. The accusative is formed by the addition of -n to the nominative form, and is the case used for direct objects. Other objective functions, including dative functions are achieved with prepositions, all of which normally take the nominative case. Direction of motion can be expressed either by the accusative case, or by the preposition al (to) with the nominative. Ido In Ido the -n suffix is optional, as subject–verb–object order is assumed when it is not present. Note that this is sometimes done in Esperanto, especially by beginners, but it is considered incorrect while in Ido it is the norm.== Finnish  nominative or the genitive case|genitive, except for personal pronouns and the personal interrogative pronoun kuka/ken, which have a special accusative form ending in -t.The major new Finnish grammar, Iso suomen kielioppi, breaks with the traditional classification to limit the accusative case to the special case of the personal pronouns and kuka/ken. The new grammar considers other total objects as being in the nominative or genitive case. Hungarian The accusative case in Hungarian applies to nouns, pronouns; even to adjectives and numerals when either of them stands alone in the sense of direct object.Accusative is formed by the suffix -t. In many cases, -t is preceded by a suffix-initial vowel, primarily based on specific vowel harmony, resulting in -at, -et, -ot, or -öt. The rules are complex, also involve consonants, and have exceptions. Thus: kertet (garden), kéket (blue);  falat (wall), hatot (six); polcot (shelf), nyolcat (eight); ködöt (fog), könyvet (book).In fewer cases, the root of the word is also affected. Word endings -a or -e will (even if they are the endings of a preceding suffix) change to -á and -é, respectively, before -t. E.g.: fa (tree) -&gt; fát. The long vowel of a one-syllable word may get shortened. E.g.: úr (lord) -&gt; urat. But: búr (Boer) -&gt; búrt. If a word has more than one syllable and the last syllable ends in a consonant, the vowel of the last syllable may drop. E.g.: köröm (fingernail) -&gt; körmöt. But: köröm (my circle) -&gt; körömet. Notably, the first-person and second-person personal pronouns have quite unique accusative forms (indeed, as indicated in the table, in the singular case the ending -et is rather optional, even considered archaic).{| class="wikitable"|-!!

It is  preserved today only in literary Arabic and Geez.
