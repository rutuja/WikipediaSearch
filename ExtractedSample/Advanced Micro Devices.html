AMD is the second-largest global supplier of microprocessors based on the x86 architecture and also one of the largest suppliers of graphics processing units. It also owns 8.6% of Spansion, a supplier of non-volatile flash memory.  AMD is the only significant rival to Intel in the central processor (CPU) market for (x86 based) personal computers. Together they held 99.1 percent (Intel 80.3%, AMD 18.8%) of the CPUs sold for quarter three of 2011 .  AMD and competitor Nvidia dominate the graphics processor (GPU) market, covering all of the top 70% of the performance benchmark, and making up 78 percent (Nvidia 44.8%, AMD 33.2%) of the GPUs in use in (x86 based) personal computers (Intel holding 6.6%) . ]]   Lone Star campus in Austin, Texas]] Jerry Sanders Ed Turney, Jack Gifford RAM chip business in 1975. That same year, it introduced a reverse engineering|reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080 microprocessor. During this period, AMD also designed and produced a series of bit-slice processor elements (Am2900, Am29116, Am293xx) which were used in various minicomputer designs. AMD 29K FSK modem, one of the first multistandard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex. The AMD 29K survived as an embedded processor and AMD spinoff Spansion continues to make industry leading flash memory.  AMD decided to switch gears and concentrate solely on Intel-compatible microprocessors and flash memory, placing them in direct competition with Intel for x86 compatible processors and their flash memory secondary markets.AMD announced the acquisition of ATI Technologies on July 24, 2006. AMD paid $4.3&amp;nbsp;billion in cash and 58&amp;nbsp;million shares of its stock for a total of US$5.4&amp;nbsp;billion. The transaction completed on October 25, 2006.  Justice Department antitrust violations in the graphics card industry, including the act of fixing prices.  GlobalFoundries Inc.. This partnership will allow AMD to focus solely on chip design. In August 2011, AMD announced that former Lenovo executive Rory Read would be joining the company as CEO. On November 3, 2011 AMD said it was going to lay off 1,400 employees or about 10 percent of current worldwide staff. The curtailment will be finalized at Q1 2012 and mainly before Christmas 2011. It will cut operational saving by $10 million in Q4 2011 and more than $200 million in 2012.    ==  8086 and 8088 processors. IBM PC, i386 part. AMD challenged Intels decision to cancel the agreement and won in arbitration, but Intel disputed this decision. A long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the Supreme Court of California sided with AMD. Subsequent legal disputes centered on whether AMD had legal rights to use derivatives of Intels microcode. In the face of uncertainty, AMD was forced to develop clean room designed versions of Intel code.In 1991, AMD released the Am386, its clone of the Intel 386 processor. It took less than a year for the company to sell a million units. Later, the Am486 was used by a number of large original equipment manufacturers, including Compaq, and proved popular. Another Am486-based product, the Am5x86, continued AMDs success as a low-price alternative. However, as product cycles shortened in the PC industry, the process of reverse engineering Intels products became an ever less viable strategy for AMD.==  K5 which was launched in 1996.    The "K" was a reference to Kryptonite, which from comic book lore, was the only substance (radioactive pieces of his home planet) which could harm Superman, a clear reference to Intel, which dominated in the market at the time, as "Superman".     The numeral "5" refers to the fifth processor generation, which Intel introduced as Pentium because the US Trademark and Patent Office ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked. K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intels Pentium II (sixth generation processor). Alpha processor bus.  The Duron was a lower cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA(socket A) or soldered directly on to the motherboard. Sempron was released as a lower cost Athlon XP replacing Duron in the socket A PGA era and since migrated upward to all new sockets up to AM3.On October 9, 2001 the Athlon XP was released, followed by the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache on February 10, 2003.   ==   The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a x86-64|64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set (officially called AMD64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called HyperTransport, as part of the Direct Connect Architecture. The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server-oriented processor.  Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded Athlon 64.  dual core processor family—the Athlon 64 X2—came a month later.  In early May 2007, AMD had abandoned the string "64" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of x86-64|64-bit computing in its processors while upcoming updates involved some of the improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. AMD has also started to release dual-core Sempron processors in early 2008 exclusively in China, branded as Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache, thus the firm completes its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment. Phenom processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, Multi-core|triple-core,  and Multi-core|quad-core versions with all cores on a single die. A new platform codename "Spider" was released utilising the new Phenom processor as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series. This was built at 65nm, hence it was uncompetitive with Intel, which had already progressed to the smaller and more power efficient 45nm node. Phenom built R700 GPU DDR2 memory that was used with the platform. In April 2010 a new Phenom II hexa-core (6 core) processor codenamed "Thuban" was released by AMD. This is a totally new die based on the hexa-core "Istanbul" Opteron processor. It also includes AMDs "turbo core" technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.   This is part of AMDs Enthusiast platform codenamed ”Leo" utilising a new Phenom II processor, a new chipset from the AMD 800 chipset series and an ATI "Cypress" GPU from the Evergreen (GPU family) GPU series.The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts will be released in 2010.  The Magny Cours part will come in 8 to 12 cores and the Lisbon part will come in 4 and 6 core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (Multi-Chip Module) with two hexa-core "Istanbul" Opteron parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45&amp;nbsp;nm SOI process.==  northbridge chip completely from the motherboard. The initiative will see some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. Floating Point Unit operations) moved to the GPU, which is better optimized for calculations such as Floating Point Unit calculations. This is referred to by AMD as an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU).    AMD will move to a modular design methodology named "M-SPACE", where two new processor cores, codenamed "Bulldozer (processor)|Bulldozer" and "Bobcat (processor)|Bobcat" will be released; Bulldozer is slated for the 2011 timeframe, whereas Bobcat is expected in Q4 2010.    HPC applications FMA4 and CVT16 instructions,  while the Bobcat core will focus on 1 watt to 10 watt products, given that the core is a simplified x86 core to reduce power draw. Both of the cores will be able to incorporate full DirectX compatible GPU core(s) under the Fusion label, or as standalone products as a general purpose CPU. Northbridge functions, and labeled on AMDs new timeline as using "Socket FM1" with DDR3 memory. This will, however, not be based on the new bulldozer core and will in fact be similar to the current Phenom II "Deneb" processor serving as AMDs high-end processor until the release of the new 32&amp;nbsp;nm parts. On September 28, 2011, AMD said that the third quarter of 2011 wont have a 10% revenue increase as AMD planned before, because of the manufacturing problem with the 32nm Llano Fusion chips.  OS as Bulldozer microarchitecture, including Zambezi and Orochi for the desktop and Interlagos and Valencia for the server market. AMD’s Bulldozer/Orochi core die size is 315mm^2. On August 31, 2011, AMDs Bulldozer created a new world record for CPU speed of 8429.4MHz (the old record was 8308.9MHz). On September 26, 2011, new Opteron central processing units (CPUs), AMDs first new micro-architecture in eight years, will be unveiled. According to AMD, these new microprocessors performance is 35% higher than current Opteron chips. == After acquiring the graphics processor maker ATI Technologies in 2007, AMD restructured some of its combined product lines. Since 2010, all of the companys graphics processing products have been marketed under the AMD brand name.  The following are notable graphics processing product families and technologies by AMD: Mobility Radeon is a series of power-optimized versions of Radeon graphics chips for use in laptops.
