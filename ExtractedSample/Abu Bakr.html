He was called Al-Siddiq (The Truthful) Juan Eduardo Campo, "Encyclopedia of Islam", Infobase Publishing, 2009    and was known by that title among later generations of Muslims.As a young man, Abu Bakr became a cloth merchant and he traveled extensively in Arabia and neighboring lands in the Middle East, through which he gained both wealth and experience. He eventually came to be recognized as the chief of his clan. The   was married to Muhammad, strengthening the ties between the two men. Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor and close friend to the Prophet. During the lifetime of Muhammad, he was involved in several campaigns such as the   and was made one of the witnesses over the pact. Abu Bakrs Caliphate lasted for a little over two years (or 27 months), ending with his death after an illness. Though the period of his caliphate was not long it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time, a remarkable achievement in its own right. He set in motion a historical trajectory that in few decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history.Abu Bakrs full name is Abd Allah ibn Uthman ibn Aamir ibn Amr ibn Kaab ibn Saad ibn Tamim ibn Murrah ibn Kaab ibn Luai ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr al-Quraishi at-Tamimi.  In Arabic, the name Abd Allah means (servant of God). Although he is most known by his title Abu Bakr, he has many other titles. One of his titles was atiqe (the saved one) and he was known by this title before Islam. Muhammad confirmed this title later when he said that Abu Bakr is the atiqe (the one saved from hell fire by God).  He was called Al-Siddiq (the truthful)  by the Prophet after he believed him in the event of Isra and Miraj when other people didnt, and Ali confirmed that title several times. He was mentioned in the Quran as the "second of the two who lay in the cave" in reference to the event of Hijra (Islam)|hijra, with the Prophet Muhammad where they hid in the cave in Jabal Thawr from the Meccan search party that was sent after them, thus being one of few who were given direct reference to in the Quran. Imam Jafar al Sadiq famously narrated how the title Siddiq was given to Abu Bakr from Muhammad.   He was also a direct descendant of Abu Bakr from his maternal side, as well as being a paternal descendant of Ali from his fathers side. Jafar al-Sadiq was also the successor of the Naqshbandi Sufi order originating from Abu Bakr himself.     Imam Muhammad al Baqir, the father of Imam Jafar Sadiq also called Abu Bakr with the title Siddiq.  Quraysh tribe. Abu Bakrs fathers name was Uthman Abu Quhafa (nicknamed Abu Quhafa) and his mother was Salma Umm-ul-Khair (nicknamed Umm-ul-Khair). Abu Bakr was a thin man with white skin.  Tabari relates (Suyuti also relates the same through Ibn Sad al-Baghdadis report) from Aisha her description of Abu Bakr: He was a man with fair skin, thin, emaciated, with a sparse beard, a slightly hunched frame, sunken eyes and protruding forehead, and the bases of his fingers were hairless.  He spent his early childhood like other Arab children of the time among the Bedouins who called themselves Ahl-i-Baeer- the people of the camel, and developed a particular fondness for camels. In his early years he played with the camel foals and goats, and his love for camels earned him the nickname "Abu Bakr", the father of the foal of the camel.  blood money in cases of murder. His office was something like the office of an honorary magistrate. Like other children of the rich Meccan merchant families, Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for Arabic poetry|poetry. He used to attend the annual fair at Shair|Ukaz, and participate in poetical symposia. He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the genealogy of the Arab tribes, their stories and their politics. == free male Ali ibn Abi Talib, though to Shias Ali always knew of Muhammads status through pre-knowledge.  However, Ali was still a pre-pubescent child when he accepted Islam, and therefore may have been excluded from the duties of a Muslim. Also Abu Bakr was the first person outside the family of Muhammad to openly become a Muslim.== His wife Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza did not accept Islam and he divorced her. His other wife, Um Ruman, became a Muslim. All his children except Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr‎ accepted Islam, and Abu Bakr separated from his son Abdul-Rahman.His conversion brought the most benefit to Islam. Abu Bakrs brought many people to Islam. He persuaded his intimate friends to convert to Islam.   and presented Islam to others in such a way that many of his friends accepted Islam.Those who converted to Islam at the instance of Abu Bakr were: * Uthman Ibn Affan (who would became the 3rd Caliph)* Al-Zubayr (played a part in the Muslim conquest of Egypt) Talha Ibn Ubayd-Allah* Abdur Rahman bin Awf (who would remain an important part of the Rashidun Caliphate)* Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas (played a part in the Islamic conquest of Persia)* Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (who remained commander in chief of the Rashidun army in Syria )* Abu Salama (Abdullah bin Abdul Asad)* Khalid ibn Sa`id* Abu Hudhaifah ibn al-MughirahAbu Bakrs acceptance proved to be a milestone in Muhammads mission. Slavery was common in Mecca, and many slaves accepted Islam. When an ordinary free man accepted Islam, despite opposition, he would enjoy the protection of his tribe. For slaves however, there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution. Abu Bakr felt compassion for slaves, so he purchased eight slaves(four men and four women) and then freed them, paying 40,000 dinar for their freedom.  The men were* Bilal ibn Ribah* Abu Fakih* Ammar ibn Yasir* Abu FuhayraThe women were:* Lubaynah* Al-Nahdiah* Umm Ubays* Harithah bint al-MuammilMost of the slaves liberated by Abu Bakr were either women or old and frail men.  The father of Abu Bakr asked him to for why doesnt he liberate strong and young slaves who could be a source of strength for him, Abu Bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of Allah, and not for his own sake. According to Sunni tradition the following verses of the Quran were revealed due to this:  He who gives in charity and fears Allah And in all sincerity testifies to the Truth; We shall indeed make smooth for him the path of Bliss {92:5-7}.  Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification; And have in their minds no favor from any one For which a reward is expected in return, But only the desire to seek the Countenance, Of their Lord, Most High; And soon they shall attain complete satisfaction {92:8-21}. Shias maintain these verses were revealed about Ali.==  Quraysh tribe rushed at Abu Bakr, and beat him mercilessly till he lost consciousness.  Following this incident Abu Bakrs mother converted to Islam. Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Abu Bakrs beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, but not by the entire Quraysh tribe.Being the first man to go over to Islam, Abu Bakr had brought upon himself the special anger and hatred of the Meccan chiefs. Soon he felt hard pressed and asked permission of Muhammad to go to Abyssinia. The permission was granted and Abu Bakr set off on his journey. However, on the way he met Ibn-ud-Daghinna, the chief of Qara. Under Ibn-ud-Daghinnas protection, he soon came back to Makkah.   Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the Qarah  tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr.In 620 Muhammads wife and uncle died. Abu Bakrs daughter Aisha was engaged to Muhammad, however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammads Isra and Miraj (night Journey).  In 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of Medina, Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh led by Ikrima attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad in his migration for Medina. Due to the danger of the Quraysh, they did not take the road to Medina. They moved in the opposite direction, and took refuge in a cave in Jabal Thawr some five miles south of Mecca. `Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and talks of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. Asma bint Abi Bakr, the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day.  Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to sight them. Due to this the following verse of the Quran was revealed: If ye help not (your Leader) (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help him; when the unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion: they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion "Have no Fear, for Allah is with us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.    Abu Sa`eed ibn Abbaas interpreting this verse said Abu Bakr was the one who stayed with the Prophet in that cave It is narrated from Al-Bara ibn `Azib|al-Barra ibn Azib, he said,  Mushrikeen were Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Jusham who rode his horse, so I said to the Messenger of Allah, "This man has succeeded in pursuing us O Messenger of Allah," but he answered, "ﻻ ﺗﺤﺰ ﻥ ﺇ ﻥ ﺍﷲ ﻣﻌﻨﺎ" (Do not worry, verily Allah is with us).  Anas from Abu Bakr he said, Anno hegiræ (2002) compiled by Dr. Muhammad ibn Shamil as-Sulami, page 16, ISBN 979-3407-19-0  After staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to Medina, staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina. While Sunni sources portray Abu bakr in an exalted light in the cave, Shia sources however generally tend to portray the incident in the cave as a Quranic condemndation of Abu Bakr for cowardice and fear.== brother in faith. Abu Bakrs relationship with Khaarjah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah.Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari used to live at Sukh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakrs family arrived in Medina he bought another house near Muhammads. The climate of Mecca was dry, but the climate of Medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick. Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He was a wholesaler, and had his store at Sukh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished at Medina. Early in 623, Abu Bakrs daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthen the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad. == Battle of Badr and Uhud In 624 Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the  s during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad to a place of safety. Conflict with Jewish tribes Later in the year Abu Bakr was a part of campaign again the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir.In 627 he participated in the Battle of the Trench and also in the Invasion of Banu Qurayza. In 628 he participated in Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and was made one of the witnesses over the pact.  campaign to Khaybar.Military campaigns during final years of Muhammad In 629 Muhammad sent Amr ibn al-As to Zaat-ul-Sallasal from where he called for reinforcements and Muhammad sent Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah. Commanding an army under him were Abu Bakr and Umar and they attacked and defeated the enemy.  Tabuk under Muhammads command and he was reported to have given all his wealth for the preparation of this expedition.In 631, Muhammad sent a delegation of three hundred Muslims from Medina to perform the Hajj according to the new Islamic way. Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates in some Sunni accounts. If this version is correct Abu Bakr had thus the honor of being the first Amir-ul-Haj in the history of Islam. In 632 Abu Bakr followed Muhammad to Mecca for the farewell Hajj.Military campaigns as commander Abu Bakr also led 1 military campaign as commander, known as   on the order of Muhammad.  Many were killed and taken as prisoner.  The Sunni Hadith collection, Sunan Abu Dawud mentions the event A short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad became ill. In his fatal illness, Muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit. After thanking and praising Allah he said,ﺇ ﻥ ﺍ ﷲ ﺧﻴﺮ ﻋﺒﺪﺍ ﺑﻴﻦ ﺍﻟﺪ ﻧﻴﺎ ﻭ ﺑﻴﻦ ﻣﺎ ﻋﻨﺪ ﻩ ﻓﺎ ﺧﺘﺎ ﺭ ﺫ ﻟﻚ ﺍﻟﻌﺒﺪ ﻣﺎ ﻋﻨﺪ ﺍﷲ"Allah has given one of His Slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly life whatever he likes or to accept the good which is with Allah. So he has chosen that good which is with Allah." Slave of Allah to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says "our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you". It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant, as Abu Bakr later told the companions.Muhammad continued: No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is sufficient. Let no Door of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr    mosque of Muhammad died Musa ibn Imran went and remained hidden from his people for forty days. Musa returned after it was said that he had died. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death."  Abu Bakr arrived and said, "Sit down, O Umar!" But Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said, turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful." (3.144)Umar said, "By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had passed away." There are many ahadith that mention the virtues and special position of Abu Bakr:Abu Huraira reported that the Islamic prophet Muhammad said, "There is not anyone who may have been kind to us, or helped us without my returning to him (his favor) except Abu Bakr.  The kindness that he has shown us, only Allah will reward him for that on the Day of Resurrection.  No ones property has been of benefit to me as much as Abu Bakrs.  And if I were to take a Khaleel (close friend from my companions) then I would take Abu Bakr as one.  But you must know that I am Allahs Khaleel.  Ayshah reported that Muhammad said, "It does not behoove a people who have Abu Bakr among them to have anybody other than him as their imam. Jami Tirmidhi  Ayshah also reported that the Muhammad  said to her: "Call your father (Abu Bakr) and brother   here so I will put something down in writing, for truly I fear lest someone forward a claim or form some ambition, and Allah and the believers refuse anyone other than Abu Bakr."   from Sahih Muslim Jubayr ibn Mutim reported that a woman came and spoke to Muhammad about a matter.  He asked her to come back later some time.  She said, "Tell me if I come later and do not find you?"  Jubayr ibn Mutim said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back.  He said, "If you do not find me then go to Abu Bakr."  Abu Hurairah reported that Muhammad said, "Jibreel came to me, held my hand and pointed out to me the gate of Paradise through which my Ummah will enter it."  Abu Bakr said, "O Messenger of Allah!  I wish that I had been with you and seen the gate!"  So, Muhammad said, "Know, O Abu Bakr, you will be the first of my Ummah to enter Paradise."  Ibn Umar said that one day, Muhammad came out and entered the masjid, Abu Bakr and Umar with him, to his right and left.  Muhammad had held their hands and he said, "The three of us will be raised on the Day of Resurrection in this way."  Abu Saeed al Khudri reported that Muhammad said: "Every prophet has two wazeer (ministers) from the dwellers of the heaven (angels) and two wazeer from the inhabitants of the earth.  So, my wazeer from the dwellers of heaven are Jibrael and Mikael and my wazeer from the earthlings are Abu Bakr and Umar."    After Muhammads death, previously dormant tensions between the Meccan  , to discuss whom they would support as their new leader. When Abu Bakr was informed of the meeting, he, Umar, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and a few others rushed to prevent the Ansar from making a premature decision. Accounts of this meeting vary greatly. All agree that during the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, and thus Abu Bakr became the first Muslim caliph, who was given the title, Khalifa-tul-Rasool (Successor of messenger of Allah), a title only accepted by Sunni Muslims. Shias criticise Abu Bakr for forsaking the funeral of Muhammad to attend the political gathering, and believe that Muhammad had already appointed Ali in his lifetime as his successor. This view portrays Abu Bakr and Umar as plotters in a political coup against the Alids. The Ismaili Shia Institute researcher Wilfred Madelung   portrays Abu Bakr as a political opportunist whose character as the founder of Sunni Islam has been extensively embellished by subsequent kings and emperors (caliphs) making it difficult to openly criticise him. Some sects of Islam like Shia strongly believe that Abu Bakr deceived Ali, keeping Ali from his right as khilafat since he was true successor to Muhammad. Sunnis on the other hand believe that all the Muslims in Madina gave their allegiance to Abu Bakr, including Ali. All Sunnis acknowledged Abu Bakr as the rightful successor to the Prophet. On account of him being one of the earliest of companions, and on account of his aiding and supporting the Prophet in his mission from the very early days of Islam, from his deep knowledge and piety from having spent so many years with the Prophet, and on account of so many indications that the Prophet gave that Abu Bakr is the right successor. Examples of these include the Prophet specifically designating Abu Bakr to lead the Muslims in prayer in his last days when he was too ill to lead the prayer. The Prophet also appointed to Abu Bakr to lead the pilgrimage to Makka. There was also a time when a woman came to the Prophet with a question and he asked her to come back tomorrow, she then asked "What if I do not find you", and he then said "Go to Abu Bakr". According to Sunnis all of these show the virtue of Abu Bakr and his being the rightful successor. After assuming the office of Caliphate Abu Bakrs first address was as follow: I have been given the authority over you, and I am not the best of you. If I do well, help me; and if I do wrong, set me right. Sincere regard for truth is loyalty and disregard for truth is treachery. The weak amongst you shall be strong with me until I have secured his rights, if God wills; and the strong amongst you shall be weak with me until I have wrested from him the rights of others, if God wills. Obey me so long as I obey God and His Messenger. But if I disobey God and His Messenger, ye owe me no obedience. Arise for your prayer, God have mercy upon you.   Arabia in campaign against Eastern Roman largest empires in history. He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.==  Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakrs succession, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. Several Arabic tribes revolted against Abu Bakr. In four of the six centres of the insurrection, the rebels rallied around people who claimed to be prophets, the most prominent among these was Musaylimah. The tribes claimed that they had submitted to Muhammad only, and that with Muhammads death, their allegiance had ended. This was common practice in pre-islamic Arabia. After the death of a tribal leader the alliance with the tribe of that leader was regarded as having ended.  Thus several tribes acted in accordance to this pre-islamic practice and refused to pay Zakat. Abu Bakr, however, insisted that they had not just submitted to a simple human leader but joined the Muslim religious community, of which he was the new head. So, in contrast to pre-islamic times, their allegiance was not seen as having ended at all. Arabic for Mahra region and Yemen.  Abu Bakr planned his strategy accordingly and formed the Muslim army into 11 corps. The strongest corps, and this was the main punch of the Muslim army, was that of Khalid ibn al-Walid and was used to fight the most powerful of the rebel forces. Other corps were given areas of secondary importance in which to bring the less dangerous apostate tribes. Abu Bakrs plan was first to clear the area of west and central Arabia (the area nearest Medina), then tackle Malik ibn Nuwayrah, and finally concentrate against the most dangerous enemy Musaylimah. After series of successful campaigns, Khalid ibn al-Walid finally defeated Musaylimah and his tribe, the Banu Hanifa, in the Battle of Yamama.  The Campaign of the Apostasy was fought and completed during the eleventh year after Hijra (Islam)|Hijra. The year 12 Hijri dawned, on 18 March 633, with Arabia united under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.This phenomenon was later regarded as primarily a religious movement by Arabic historians. However, the early sources indicate that in reality it was mainly political.  Frank Griffel: Apostasie und Toleranz im Islam, p.61  After all, the revolting Arabs only refused to pay Zakat (Charity), but they did not refuse to perform the salah.  This however is disputed and explained by Muslim scholars in that the dictation of Zakat was one of the Five pillars of Islam and its denial or withholding is an act of denial of a cornerstone of faith, and is therefore an act of apostasy. Bernard Lewis states that the fact that Islamic Historians have regarded this as a primarily religious movement was due to a later interpretation of events in terms of a theological world-view. Bernard Lewis: The Arabs in History, p.65 The opponents of the Muslim armies were not only apostates, but also - if not most of them - tribes which were largely or even completely independent from the Muslim community. However, these revolts also had a religious aspect: Medina had become the centre of a social and political system, of which religion was an integral part; consequently it was inevitable that any reaction against this system should have a religious aspect. == According to Sunni Islam, Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the Quran in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama fought in 632, Umar (the later Caliph Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the Quran had died in battle. Fearing that the Quran may be lost or corrupted, Umar requested the Caliph Abu Bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the Book in written format. After initial hesitation, Abu Bakr made a committee headed by Zayd ibn Thabit which included the memorizers of the Quran and Umar and to collect all verses of the Book. After collecting all Quranic verses from texts in the possession of various sahaba, Zayd ibn Thabit and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the Quran. After they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down, the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in a book form to the Caliph Abu Bakr. It is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of Muhammad when most of his sahaba (companions) were still alive.Prior to his death, Abu Bakr gave this authorized copy of the Quran to Umar - his successor. It remained with him throughout his tenure as Caliph (10 years). Prior to his death, Umar gave this Book to his daughter Hafsa bint Umar, who was one of the wives of Muhammad. Umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed, and thus preferred to leave this copy with Hafsa so as not to indicate his personal preference of who would be the next caliph. Later on, it became the basis of Uthman Ibn Affans definitive text of the Quran which was published far and wide merely 18 years after the death of Muhammad. Later historians give Uthman Ibn Affan the principal credit for re-verification and publishing the Quran. Shias reject the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the Quran. == largest empires in history. Abu Bakr began with Iraq, the richest province of Persian Empire. He sent his most brilliant general Khalid ibn al-Walid to invade the Sassanid Empire.==  After the Ridda Wars, a tribal chief of north eastern Arabia, Muthanna ibn Haris, raided the Persian towns in Iraq. With the success of the raids, a considerable amount of booty was collected. Muthanna ibn Haris went to Medina to inform Caliph Abu Bakr about his success and was appointed commander of his people, after which he began to raid deeper into Iraq. Using the mobility of his light cavalry he could easily raid any town near the desert and within moments could disappear again in to the desert, into which the Sassanid army was unable to chase them. Muthanna’s acts made Abu Bakr think about the expansion of the Rashidun Empire. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 554. Abu Bakr started with the invasion of Iraq. The problems faced by Abu Bakr were that the Arabs feared the Persians with a deep, unreasoning fear which ran in the tribal consciousness as a racial complex and was the result of centuries of Persian power and glory. In return the Persian regarded the Arab with contempt. It was important not to suffer a defeat, for that would confirm and strengthen this instinctive fear. To make certain of victory, Abu Bakr decided on two measures; that the invading army would consist entirely of volunteers; and he put in command of the army his best general Khalid ibn al-Walid. After defeating the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama, Khalid was still at Al-Yamama when Abu Bakr sent him orders to invade the Sassanid Empire. Making Al-Hirah the objective of Khalid, Abu Bakr sent reinforcements and ordered the tribal chiefs of north eastern Arabia, Muthanna ibn Haris, Mazhur bin Adi, Harmala and Sulma to operate under the command of Khalid along with their men. In about third week of March 633 (first week of Muharram 12th Hijrah) Khalid set out from Al-Yamama with an army of 10,000.  The tribal chiefs, with 2,000 warriors each, joined Khalid; Thus Khalid entered the Persian Empire with 18,000 troops. double envelopment Siege of Siege of Al-Anbar. Battle of Sassanid Persians, Byzantine Roman Romans and Christian Arabs in the Battle of Firaz in December 633. This was the last battle in his conquest of Iraq. While Khalid was on his way to attack Qadissiyah, a key fort in the way to Persian Capital Ctesiphon, he received the letter of Caliph Abu Bakr and was sent to Roman front in Syria to assume the command of Muslim armies to conquer Roman Syria. ==  With a successful invasion of Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Abu Bakr’s confidence grew.  He concentrated four large corps at Zhu Qissah and sent them to Roman Syria. Each corps was assigned its own commander and its own target. The leaders of the different corps received intelligence of a concentration of large Byzantine armies at Ajnadayn while on the march. The army stopped its advance and the leaders wrote to Abu Bakr for help. Since the Muslim position in Iraq was stable by now, the Caliph accordingly wrote to Khalid to take half of his forces of Iraq to Syria and to assume command of all Muslim armies in Byzantine Syria. The Byzantine province of Syria in those days consisted of modern day Syria, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon and southern Turkey. There were two routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal and the other was through Mesopotamia passing though Ar Raqqah. Since it was believed that the Muslim armies in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the conventional route to Syria via Daumat ul Jandal because it was a long route and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also did not take the Mesopotamian route because Roman garrisons held northern Syria and northern Mesopotamia. A conflict with these Roman forces would have forced Khalid to spend too much time while Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria. Khalid selected, instead, a short and unconventional route to Syria, passing though the Syrian Desert. Although probably hyperbole, some sources state that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water before reaching an oasis that Khalid had selected in advance. Khalid thus entered Northern Syria at a point where he was least expected, catching the Byzantine forces on their right flank. More recent historians  have suggested that this surprises attack unhinged the Byzantine defenses in Syria.Khalid entered Syria in June 634 and quickly captured the border forts of  Qaryatayn and Ghassanid army siege of Bosra, which surrendered some time in mid July 634. thus effectively ending the Ghassanid Dynasty. Here Khalid took over the command of Muslim armies in Syria from Abu Ubaidah, as per the instructions of Caliph. The massive Byzantine armies were concentrating at Ajnadayn to push the invading armies back to desert. Early Muslim sources have mentioned its size to be 90,000, while most of the modern historians doubt the figures, but consider this battle to be the key to breaking the Byzantine power in Syria. According to the instructions of Khalid all Muslim corps concentrated at Ajnadayn, where they fought a decisive battle against Byzantine on 30 July 634. Battle of conquered Damascus siege of Damascus and Umar became the new Caliph. He dismissed his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid from the command and appointed Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah the new commander in chief of Islamic army in Syria. Abu Ubaidah got the letter of his appointment and Khalids disposal during the siege, but he delayed the announcement until the city was conquered.On 23 August 634, Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover due to his old age. There are two accounts about the sickness of Abu Bakr. One account states that 8 August 634 was a cold day and when Abu Bakr took a bath, he caught a chill. Another account indicates that, about a year before, along with some other companions, Harith bin Kaladah and Attab bin Usaid, he had eaten some poisoned food which did not affect him for a year.Abu Bakr developed high fever and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged and when his condition worsened he felt that his end was near. Realizing his death was near, he sent for Ali and requested him to perform his ghusl since Ali had also done it for the Prophet Muhammad.Abu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed. He appointed Umar as his successor after discussing with some companions. Some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.Abu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to Uthman Ibn Affan as follows: Abu Bakr next asked Aisha as to how many pieces of cloth were used for Muhammads shroud. Aisha said that three pieces had been used. Abu Bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud. On Monday 23 August 634 Abu Bakr died. The funeral prayer was led by Umar. He was buried the same night by the side of Muhammads grave in Aishas house near Al-Masjid al-Nabawi==   Uthman ibn Amir Abu Quhafa Umm al-Khair Salma bint Shakhr ibn Amir ibn Kaab ibn Saad ibn Taim::Brother: Mutaq (presumably the middle) Tarikh ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk 3/ 425 ::Brother: Quhafah ibn Uthman::Himself: Atiq (presumably the eldest) Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza ibn Abd ibn Asad (divorced):::Daughter: Asma bint Abu Bakr::::Grandson Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr - His birth spread happiness amongs muslims, killed by Hajjaj bin Yousef.::::Grandson Abdullah ibn Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr::::Grandson Abu-Atiq Muhammad ibn Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr::::Grandson Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr::::Grandson Urwa ibn al-Zubayr::::Granddaughter Hafsa bint Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr:::::Great grandson Hisham ibn Urwa:::::Great grandson Aba-Sulaiman ibn Abu-Atiq Muhammad ibn Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr:::::Great grandson Talha ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr:::Son: `Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr|Abd Allaah ibn Abi Bakr Um Ruman bint Amir ibn Uwaymir ibn Zuhal ibn Dahman (from Kinanah):::Step son: Tufail ibn Abdullah, The son of Abd-Allah ibn Harith:::Son: Abdul-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr:::Daughter: Aisha|Aaishah tree::Wife: Asma bint Umays|Asma bint Umays ibn Maad ibn Taym al-Khathamiyyah (previously wife of Jafar ibn Abi Talib and after Abu Bakrs death, became the wife of Ali ibn Abi Talib):::Son: Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr Khazraj:::Daughter: Umm Khultum bint Abu Bakr.  Somali clans. In Bangladesh, they are known by the name of Qureshi. There are also Al-Atiqi or Atiqi Families in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria,Yemen, Iraq and other places in the Arabia Peninsula. All the descendants of Abu Bakr, their Ancestors are: Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr and Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr. The Al-Bakri Family in Egypt are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr while the sheekhaal or Fiqi Umar Family found in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya and the Aala Atiq Families found in the Arabia Peninsula are the descendants of Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr.Abu Bakr became the Caliph on 8 June 632 and he died on 23 August 634. Though the period of his caliphate covers only two years, two months and fifteen days, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time: the Sassanid Empire and Byzantine Empire.Abu Bakr had the distinction of being the first Caliph in the history of Islam and also the first Caliph to nominate a successor. He was the only Caliph in the history of Islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate  .He is revered for being the first Muslim ruler to establish:* Bayt al-mal* The Crown Pasture* Ijtihad .He has the distinction of purchasing the land for Al-Masjid al-Nabawi. Quraysh and was well accomplished at interpreting dreams according to Ibn Sirin.== Aws and Khazraj regarding who would become the ruler over the Muslims after Muhammad. This even led to drawing of swords between them. Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah rushed to the spot where the dispute almost turned bloody, and delivered his famous speech to show the path of unity between the Muslims and declared that Umar should become the first caliph. In turn, Umar declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr saying that there is no better man amongst the Muslims after Muhammad. The majority of the sahaba (companions of Muhammad) assembled there followed suit and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr. Sunnis point out this fact of avoiding bloodshed between Muslims and preserving the unity of the state as of paramount importance, or it would have led to self-destruction of the new state. The famous scholar Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal also stated that he is among the foremost companions (sahaba) of prophet Muhammad.==    Ghadir Khumm. It is also believed that Abu Bakr and Umar conspired to take over power in the Muslim nation after Muhammads death, in a coup détat against Ali. The Shia do not view Abu Bakrs being with Muhammad in the cave when the two fled Mecca as a meritorious act and indeed find significant criticsm of Abu Bakr in the Quranic verse of the cave.The Shia criticize Abu Bakr for an alleged dispute between him and Muhammads daughter, Fatimah, that was set off by Abu Bakr and Umars setting fire to and storming her house, and eventuated in her becoming angry with Abu Bakr and refusing to talk with him for the rest of her life; she died a few weeks later.  Furthermore, Abu Bakr had refused to grant her the lands of Fadak which Muhammad had given to her as a gift before his death. He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father.  However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the Prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. Some Shia also accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima.  (see Fadak)The Shia believe that Abu Bakr sent Khalid ibn Walid to crush those who were in favour of Alis caliphate (see Ridda Wars). The Shia strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the Quran, claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali ==Edward Gibbon wrote about Abu Bakr as: The moderation, and the veracity of Abu Bakr confirmed the new religion,  and furnished an example for invitation. William Muir states that: Abu Bakrs judgment was sound and impartial; his conversation agreeable and his demeanor affable and much sought after by the Quraysh and he was popular throughout the city.... The faith of Abu Bakr was the greatest guarantee of Muhammads sincerity in the beginning of his career, and indeed, in a modified sense, throughout his life.  To have such a person as a staunch adherent of his claim, was for Muhammad a most important step. William Montgomery Watt writes: From 622 to 632 he (Abu Bakr) was Mohammeds chief adviser, but had no prominent public functions except that he conducted the pilgrimage to Mecca in 631, and led the public prayers in Medina during Mohammeds last illness.  It has been transmitted from  , Ar-Rahim."In al-Adab al-Mafrud of Imam Al-Bukhari and in ibn Majah and the Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, it has been reported from Abu Bakr that Muhammad said, "Stick to speaking the truth because truth is a companion of birr (righteousness) and both these are in Paradise; and abstain from lying because it is a companion of fujur (sin) and both these are in Hell."It is reported in Sunan Abu Dawood, Ahmad, and Tirmidhi that Abu Bakr said, "O people! You recite the verse (5:105): O you who believe!  Guard your own souls; if you follow (right) guidance, no hurt can come to you from those who stray, but you misinterpret it and do not know what it means.  I once heard the Messenger of Allah  say, If people see someone practicing injustice and do not set him right, Allah will almost certainly visit them all with severe punishment."  Another narration goes, "If they see evil practiced and do not attempt to change it..."According to a narration of Abu Bakr as reported in Jami al Tirmidhi, Tafsir ibn Jarir and elsewhere, when Muhammed recited this verse (4:123), "And whoever does evil shall be requited for it" to him, he felt as if his back was broken.  When Muhammed noticed the reaction on him, he asked, "What is the matter with you?"  Thereupon, Abu Bakr submitted, "Ya RasulAllah, there is hardly anyone among us who can claim to have done nothing bad in ones life.  Now if every evil deed has to be requited, who can hope to go unscathed from among us?  He said, "O Abu Bakr, you and your believing brothers need not worry about it because worldly hardships that you face shall make amends for your sins."  As it appears in another narration, he said, "O Abu Bakr, do you not get sick?  Are you never tested by distress and sorrow?"  Abu Bakr said, "No doubt, all this does happen."  Then he said, "There, this is the requital of whatever evil you may have done." * Rashidun Caliphate** Umar Uthman** Ali* Ridda wars* Qallu* Sahaba** List of Sahaba** Sunni view of the Sahaba* Muadh ibn Jabal   * Muslim:**  **  **  **  **  **  ** Lengthy biography of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq by Adam Walker  Urdu Audio**   Urdu Audio**   - www.SearchTruth.com**  **   by Happy Books* Non-Muslim:**  **  * Unclassified:**  **   Shaykh Sayyed Muhammad bin Yahya Al-Husayni Al-Ninowy.* Shia:**            </body></html>
