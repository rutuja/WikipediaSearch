It was not a compulsory part of the cursus, and hence a former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the aedileship. However, it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politicians commitment to public service, as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games, an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity. Tribunes of Roman Consuls, Roman Censors. Occasionally, if a Censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks, an Aedile would perform the task instead. Licinian rogations toga praetexta, the Curule Aediles also held the power to issue edicts (jus edicendi). These edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets, or what we might call "economic regulation".  Livy suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that both Curule as well as Plebeian Aediles were sacrosanct.  Although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical. Within five days after the beginning of their terms, the four Aediles (two Plebeian, two Curule) were required to determine, by lot or by agreement among themselves, what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over.  Julius Caesars Aedileship.  People of Patrician aristocracy), they were not technically Roman magistrate|magistrates. Before the passage of the lex annalis, individuals could run for the Aedileship by the time they turned twenty-seven. After the passage of this law in 180 BC, a higher age was set, probably thirty-five.  By the first century BC, Aediles were elected in July, and took office on the first day in January.Cicero (de Legibus|Legg. iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:(1) Care of the city: the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of sumptuary laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions.  They also punished those who had too large a share of the ager publicus, or kept too many cattle on the state pastures. (2) Care of provisions: investigation of the quality of the articles supplied and the correctness of weights and measures; the purchase of corn for disposal at a low price in case of necessity. (3) Care of the games: superintendence and organization of the public games, as well as of those given by themselves and private individuals (e.g. at funerals) at their own expense.  Ambitious persons often spent enormous sums in this manner to win the popular favor with a view to official advancement.In 44 BC Julius Caesar added two plebeian aediles, called Cereales, whose special duty was the care of the cereal (corn) supply.  Under Augustus the office lost much of its importance, its judicial functions and the care of the games being transferred to the praetor, while its city responsibilities were limited by the appointment of a praefectus urbi. Augustus took for himself its powers over various religious duties. By stripping it of its powers over temples, Augustus effectively destroyed the office, by taking from it its original function. After this point, few people were willing to hold such a powerless office, and Augustus was even known to compel individuals into holding the office. Augustus accomplished this by randomly selecting former tribunes and quaestors for the office.  Future emperors would continue to dilute the power of the office by transferring its powers to newly created offices. However, the office did retain some powers over licentiousness and disorder, in particular over the baths and brothels, as well as the registration of prostitutes.  In the 3rd century AD it disappeared altogether. Under the Empire, Roman colonies and cities often had officials with powers similar to those of the republican aediles, although their powers widely varied. It seems as though they were usually chosen annually.  Today in Portugal the county mayor can still be referred to as edil (e.g. O edil de Coimbra, meaning the mayor of Coimbra).In his play Coriolanus, Shakespeare references the aediles. However, they are minor characters, and their chief job is being policemen.   Adel (disambiguation)*Aetheling*Agoranomi*Constitution of the Roman Republic*</body></html>
