Astounding Science Fiction, July 1939), was inspired by Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin.  The story depicted a fierce, carnivorous Extraterrestrial life|alien, the coeurl, stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. It was the cover story  Panshin, Alexei (1994) “Introduction to Slan”, The Easton press,  Connecticut, USA. Available on-line http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/intoslan.htm    of the issue of Astounding that is sometimes described as having ushered in the "Golden Age" of science fiction.  The story served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies.  This   is the classic bug-eyed monster novel, the unacknowledged inspiration for the film Alien and scores of similar David Pringle|(1990) "The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction", Grafton Books, page 346.}}      In 1950 it was combined with "War of Nerves" (1950), "Discord in Scarlet" (1939) and "M33 in Andromeda" (1943) to form the novel The Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950). Canadian Department of National Defence. Extremely prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote a large number of short stories. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or "fixups" as he called them, a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction criticism. When the original stories were related (e.g. The War against the Rull) this was often successful. When not (e.g. Quest for the Future) the disparate stories thrown together generally made for a less coherent plot.One of van Vogts best-known novels of this period is Slan, which was originally serialised in Astounding Science Fiction (September - December 1940). Using what became one of van Vogts recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by Homo sapiens.In 1944, van Vogt moved to Hollywood, California, where his writing took on new dimensions after World War II. Van Vogt was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern meta-systems) -- the characters in his very first story used a system called Nexialism to analyze the aliens behaviour, and he became interested in the General Semantics of Alfred Korzybski.He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, The World of Null-A and The Pawns of Null-A in the late 1940s, and Null-A Three in the early 1980s. Null-A, or non-Aristotelian logic, refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive, inductive reasoning (compare fuzzy logic), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, deductive reasoning.Van Vogt was also profoundly affected by revelations of totalitarian police states that emerged after World War II. He wrote a mainstream novel that was set in Communist China, The Violent Man (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of "the violent male type", which he described as a "man who had to be right", a man who "instantly attracts women" and who he said were the men who "run the world".  Weapon Shop Mixed Men series and in single stories such as "Heir Apparent", whose protagonist was described as a "benevolent dictator".Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved. Several of his stories hinge upon temporal conundrum|conundra, a favorite theme. He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books, "Narrative Technique" by Thomas Uzzell, and "The Only Two Ways to Write a Story" plus "Twenty Problems of the Short-Story Writer", both by John Gallishaw.  Charles Platt,   Savoy Books, 1980.  The Beast (aka Moonbeast) (1963), Rogue Ship (1965), Quest for the Future (1970) and Supermind (1977); expanded short stories (The Darkness on Diamondia (1972), Future Glitter (aka Tyranopolis) (1973); original novels such as Children of Tomorrow (1970), The Battle of Forever (1971) and The Anarchistic Colossus (1977); plus sequels to his classic works, many of which were promised, but only one of which appeared, Null-A Three (1984; originally published in French).  Several later books were original in Europe, and at least one novel has only ever appeared in Italian, no English version yet published.On January 26, 2000, van Vogt died in Los Angeles, USA from Alzheimers disease, and was survived by his second wife, the former Lydia Bereginsky.Critical opinion about the quality of van Vogts work has been sharply divided.An early and articulate critic was the noted author Damon Knight. In a chapter-long essay reprinted in In Search of Wonder,  entitled "Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt", Knight famously remarked that van Vogt "is no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter." Knight described The World of Null-A as "one of the worst allegedly-adult science fiction stories ever published." About van Vogts writing in general, Knight said: About Empire of the Atom Knight wrote: Knight also expressed misgivings about van Vogts politics, noting that his stories almost invariably present absolute monarchy in a favorable light.On the other hand, when science fiction author Philip K. Dick was asked  Vertex, Vol. 1, no. 6, February 1974, available on-line http://www.philipkdick.com/media_vertex.html  which science fiction writers had influenced his work the most, he replied: Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knight’s criticisms: In a review of Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt, science fiction writer Paul Di Filippo said: In The John W. Campbell Letters, Campbell says, "The son-of-a-gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph, ties a knot around you, and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafter including the ultimate last one."    Harlan Ellison (who began reading van Vogt as a teenager) Ellison, Harlan   Retrieved 2001-08-31 “Van is still with us, as I write this, in June of 1999, slightly less than fifty years since I first encountered van Vogt prose in a January 1950 issue of ‘’Startling Stories’’,…”  wrote, "Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition." Writing in 1984 David Hartwell said:  The literary critic Leslie A. Fiedler said something similar:  The American literary critic Fredric Jameson says of van Vogt: }}Nevertheless, van Vogt still has his critics. For example Darrell Schweitzer writing to the New York Review of Science Fiction in 1999  quoted a passage from the original van Vogt novelette “The Mixed Men”, which he was then reading, and remarked: This is the realism, and logic, of a small boy playing with toy soldiers in a sandbox. I’m tougher than you. I’ve got a billion spaceships! They’re brand-new. They only took 800 years to develop.And this is a story in which most of the cast either have two brains or are really robots…and even the emotions of the human characters are programmed or deprogrammed as part of plots within counterplots. Next to this, Doc Smith was an icy realist. There is no intersection with adult reality at any point, for all van Vogt was able to write was that small boy’s sandbox game with an adult level of intensity. This is, I think, the secret of van Vogt’s bizarre fascination, as awful as his actual writing might be, and why he appealed so strongly to Philip K. Dick, who managed to put more adult characters and emotions into equally crazy situations. It’s ultimately very strange to find this sort of writing so prominently sponsored by supposedly rational and scientifically minded John W. Campbell, when it seems to contravene everything the Golden Age stood for.}}In 1946, van Vogt and his first wife, Edna Mayne Hull, were co-Guests of Honor at the fourth World Science Fiction Convention. In 1980, van Vogt received a "Casper Award" (precursor to the Canadian Aurora Awards) for Lifetime Achievement.  In 1995 he was awarded the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award by the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA). There was controversy over how late in van Vogt’s lifetime the SFWA left it to bestow their highest award. Writing an obituary of van Vogt a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction remarked: It is generally held that the “damnable SFWA politics” relates to Damon Knight, the founder of the SFWA, who abhorred van Vogt’s style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s. Harlan Ellison writing in 1999 the introduction  to Futures Past: The Best Short Fiction of A.E. van Vogt was more explicit:In 1996, van Vogt was recognized on two occasions: the World Science Fiction Convention presented him with a Special Award for six decades of golden age science fiction, and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame included him among its initial four inductees.The works of van Vogt were translated into French by the surrealist Boris Vian (The World of Null-A as Le Monde des Å in 1958), and van Vogt’s works were “viewed as great literature of the surrealist school”.
