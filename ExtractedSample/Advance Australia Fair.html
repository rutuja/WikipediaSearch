Created by the Scottish-born composer, Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878, but did not gain its status as the official anthem until 1984. Until then, the song was sung in Australia as a patriotic song. In order for the song to become the anthem, it had to face a vote between the Royal anthem God Save the Queen, the "unofficial anthem" Waltzing Matilda and Song of Australia. Other songs and marches have been influenced by Advance Australia Fair, such as the Australian Vice-Regal salute.The earliest known sound recording of Advance Australia Fair appears in "The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt", circa 1916, a short commercial recording dramatising arrival of the Australian troops in Egypt en route to Gallipoli. == Highland Society function in Sydney on 30 November 1878.  The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for his composition.In a letter to R. B. Fuller Esq., dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write Advance Australia Fair:  Australian Broadcasting Commission, used it to announce its news bulletins until 1952.  It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of World War II, it was played in picture theatres after "God Save the Queen" and the American national anthem. == Henry Krips, This Land of Mine, won the competition, but it was decided to make no change to the status quo.  Whitlam government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with "distinction" and started a competition to find one. The Australia Council for the Arts organised the contest, which was dubbed the Australian National Anthem Quest. The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an Australian dollar|A$5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for Advance Australia Fair, Waltzing Matilda and Song of Australia. In 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it polled 60,000 people nationally. Advance Australia Fair was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem.In January 1976 the   (28.28%), Song of Australia (9.65%), and the existing national anthem God Save the Queen (18.78%).

His Parliamentary colleague Peter Slipper thought Australia should consider another anthem. ==In 2001,  " in the national anthems lyrics by saying, "This must rank as one of the worst lines of any national anthem. That Australia is an island should be pretty obvious, but is our anthem girt by a sea of mediocrity?"  Later in 2001, Kim Beazley, the then Labor leader, defended the lyric saying, "I stand up on behalf of girt. Girt by sea needs to be celebrated and if we cant do that regularly when Australia enjoys its sporting triumphs, at the beginning of our school assemblies and I think something would be lost that is new and decent and essential to the Australian character." The anthems lyrics and the phrase "girt by sea" have also drawn criticism in the media.  In 2008, the Herald Sun published an article headed Time girt went down the gurgler, arguing that the anthems lyrics were largely irrelevant to modern Australian life and that "girt by sea" is "simply an antiquated way of making the obvious statement that we live on an island." The article suggested replacing the first four lines of the anthem with::Australians all let us rejoice,:For we are proud and free;:Weve golden sands and willing hands,:For home and family." A Christian movement, Awakening, in the 1990s substituted an alternative second verse naming Christ and promoting Christian values    An archived claim that the verse was sung in the 1930s at Smithton, Tasmania, is unsubstantiated and has been withdrawn from the original website. It was sung during the Global March for Jesus in 1998  and again at World Youth Day 2008 with the qualification This is not the official verse, but a Catholic adaptation of the Australian National Anthem.   The version was later controversially adopted by some Christian private schools for singing as a hymn at internal assemblies. Hiatt B.
