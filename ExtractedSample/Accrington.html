The name Accrington appears to be Anglo-Saxon in origin. Its derivation is uncertain. In the records it variously appears as Akarinton in 1194; Akerunton, Akerinton and Akerynton in 1258; Acrinton in 1292; Ackryngton in 1311 and Acryngton in 1324.   The name may mean acorn farmstead from Old English|Anglo-Saxon æcern meaning acorn and tun meaning farmstead or village.  The southern part of Accrington, the township of New Accrington, was formerly in the Forest of Blackburnshire and the presence of oak trees may be inferred from local place names like Broad Oak and Oak Hill. The products of oak trees were once an important food for swine and a farmstead may have been named for such produce.  Old English|Anglo-Saxon  ᴁcerntun might become Middle English Akerenton, Akerinton and the like.  Also worth considering is that in the Lancashire dialect  acorn was akran. There is no known Old English personal name from which the first element can be derived. But if the Frisian names Akkrum, Akkeringa and Dutch name Akkerghem, are derived from the personal name Akker there may be a corresponding Old English name from which Accrington may be derived.  townships which Forest of hundred of Blackburnshire.  manor of Kirkstall in grange there; removing the inhabitants to make room for it. The locals got their revenge by setting fire to the new building, destroying its contents and in the process killing the three lay brothers who occupied it.  An area of the town is named Black Abbey a possible reference to the murders. Regardless of whatever happened Accrington did not remain under monastic control for long before reverting back to the de Lacys. It is thought the monks of Kirkstall may have built a small chapel there during their tenure for the convenience of those in charge residing there and their tenants, but the records are uncertain.  What is known is that there was a chapel in Accrington prior to 1553   where the vicar of Whalley was responsible for the maintenance of divine worship. However it did not have its own minister and it was served, when at all, by the curate of one of the adjacent chapels. In 1717 Accrington was served by the curate of Church, who preached there only once a month.  St. Jamess Church was built in 1763, replacing the old chapel  however it did not achieve parochial status until as late as 1870.   Until around 1830 visitors considered Accrington to be just a "considerable village".  The Industrial Revolution, however, resulted in large changes and Accrington’s location on the confluence of a number of streams made it attractive to industry and a number of mills were built in the town in the mid-eighteenth century. Further industrialisation then followed in the late eighteenth century and local landowners began building mansions in the area on the outskirts of the settlement where their mills were located while their employees lived in overcrowded unsanitary conditions in the centre. Industrialisation resulted in rapid population growth during the nineteenth century, as people moved from over north-west England to Accrington,  with the population increasing from 3,266 in 1811 to 10,376 in 1851 to 43,211 in 1901  to its peak in 1911 at 45,029.     established church allowed nonconformism|non-conformism to flourish in the town. By the mid-nineteenth century there were Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist, United Free Methodist, Congregationalist, Baptist, Swedenborgian, Unitarian, Roman Catholic and Catholic Apostolic churches in the town.  The Swedenborgian church was so grand that it was considered to be the ‘Cathedral’ of that denomination. For many decades the textiles industry, the engineering industry and coal mining were the central activities of the town. Cotton mills and dye works provided work for the inhabitants; but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers over wages and working conditions. On the 24th April 1826 over 1,000 men and women, many armed, gathered at Whinney Hill in Clayton-le-Moors to listen to a speaker from where they marched on Sykes’s Mill at Higher Grange Lane, near the site of the modern police station and Magistrate’s Courts, and smashed over 60 looms. These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).    Chartist movement but eventually proved unsuccessful in its aims. In the early 1860s the Lancashire cotton famine badly affected Accrington, although less so than the wider area due to its more diverse economy,  with as many as half of the towns mill employees out of work at one time. Conditions were such that a Local Board of Health was constituted in 1853 and the town itself incorporated in 1878 allowing the enforcement of local laws to improve the town.  A further wave of rioting hit the town in 1962 when local men and youths clashed with some of the Asian and Caribbean Commonwealth immigrants who had settled in the town since the late 1940s. == One well-known association the town has is with the  , the   towns such as Burnley, Blackburn and Chorley.   Serre in Battle of Western Front, a line they had held since late 1914.

Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, in a disastrous day for the British Army.Later in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers &amp;mdash; in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during World War I.

The cenotaph also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from World War II.After World War I and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining.
