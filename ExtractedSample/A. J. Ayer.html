Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London from 1946 until 1959, when he became Wykeham Professor of Logic at the University of Oxford. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1951 to 1952. He was knighted in 1970. St Johns Wood, London, to a wealthy European family. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch-Jewish family who founded the Citroën car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss Calvinist financier who worked for the Rothschild family.He was educated at   football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to high-society and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.  igtheism (for example, by Paul Kurtz).  In later years Ayer did refer to himself as an atheist  and stated that he did not believe in God.  He followed in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell by debating with the Jesuit scholar Frederick Copleston on the topic of religion.Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and George Orwell, he contributed a series of articles to Polemic (magazine)|Polemic, a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater.    humanist movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.    In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded Julian Huxley as president of the British Humanist Association, a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited The Humanist Outlook, a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism.He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at  . We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men". Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out. ==In 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead",  describing an unusual near-death experience. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be."  However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief". In 2001 Dr. Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being. Im afraid Im going to have to revise all my books and opinions." Ayers son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his fathers words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his fathers version of his near death experience. Ayer is best known for popularising the verification principle, in particular through his presentation of it in Language, Truth, and Logic (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called Vienna Circle which Ayer visited as a young guest, and others including the leading light of the circle, Moritz Schlick were already offering their own papers on the issue.  Ayers own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable empirical import, otherwise it is either "Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytical" if Tautology (logic)|tautologous, or "metaphysical" (i.e. meaningless, or "literally senseless"). He started work on the book at the age of 23  and it was published when he was 26. Ayers philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and David Hume. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes Language, Truth and Logic essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century analytic philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between different types of perceptible behaviour,  an argument which anticipates the Turing test published in 1950 to test a machines capability to demonstrate intelligence (consciousness).Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher   and a short biography of Voltaire.In 1972–1973 Ayer gave the  , theology and aesthetics– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.In "The Concept of a Person and Other Essays" (1963), Ayer heavily criticized Wittgensteins private language argument. Sense and Sensibilia, a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his Metaphysics and Common Sense (1969). A priori knowledge  Ayer, A.J. (1989).
