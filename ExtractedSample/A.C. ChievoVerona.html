ChievoVerona</title></head><body> Italian football Hellas Verona.==The team was founded in 1929 by a small number of football fans from the small borough of Chievo, a Verona neighbourhood. Initially the club was not officially affiliated to the Italian Football Federation but played several amateur tournament and friendly matches under the denomination "O.N.D. Chievo", a title imposed by the fascist regime. The clubs formal debut in an official league was on 8 November 1931. The team colours at the time were blue and white. Chievo disbanded in 1936 because of economic woes but returned to play in 1948 after World War II, being registered in the regional league of "Seconda Divisione" (Second Division). In 1957 the team moved to the "Carlantonio Bottagisio" parish field, where they played until 1986. In 1959, after the restructuring of the football leagues, Chievo was admitted to play the "Seconda Categoria" (Second Category), a regional league placed next-to-last in the Italian football pyramid. That year, Chievo changed its name to "Cardi Chievo", after a new sponsor, and was quickly promoted to the "Prima Categoria", from which it experienced its first-ever relegation in 1962.== Serie C2 in 1986. As a consequence of promotion, Chievo was forced to move to the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi, the main venue in Verona; another promotion, to Serie C1, followed in 1989. In 1990, the team changed its name to its current one, "A.C. ChievoVerona". Giovanni Sartori Hellas Verona was playing at the time. In 1997, after Malesani signed for ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina, Silvio Baldini was appointed the new head coach. The following season, with Domenico Caso as the coach, saw the first dismissal of a coach during the presidency of Luca Campedelli, with Caso being fired and replaced with Lorenzo Balestro.In 2000/2001 Luigi Delneri was signed as coach and led Chievo, by virtue of its third-place finish in Serie B, to promotion to Serie A, the first time in the teams history that it had reached the top tier of Italian football.==In its 2001/2002 Serie A debut season Chievo, who were most critics choice for an instant return to Serie B, became the surprise team in the league, playing often spectacular and entertaining football and even leading the league for six consecutive weeks. The club finally ended the season with a highly respectable fifth place finish, qualifying the team to play in the UEFA Cup.In 2002/2003, Chievo debuted at the European level but were eliminated in the first round by Red Star Belgrade. The team finished the Serie A season in seventh place, again proving itself one of the better Serie A teams. The 2003/2004 season, the last with Delneri at the helm, saw Chievo finish in ninth place. Juventus and AC Milan, the team slowly lost position in the Serie A table. Three matches before the end of the season Chievo was third from last, a position which would see it relegated to Serie B. As a last resort Beretta was fired and Maurizio DAngelo, a former Chievo player, was appointed temporarily to replace him as coach. Morale improved, and two wins and a tie from the final three matches proved just enough to keep Chievo in Serie A. Treviso FBC football scandal Champions League preliminary phase. AC Milan Champions League Portuguese S.C. Braga|Braga. The first leg, played on 14 September in Braga, ended in a shock 2–0 win for the Portuguese side. The return match, played on 28 September in Verona, although won by Chievo 2–1 resulted in a 3–2 aggregate loss and the clubs elimination from the competition.On 16 October 2006, following a 1–0 defeat against Torino F.C., head coach Giuseppe Pillon was fired, and replaced by Luigi Delneri, one of the original symbols of the miracle Chievo, who had led the club to Serie A in 2002.On 27 May 2007, the last match day of the 2006–07 Serie A season, Chievo was one of five teams in danger of falling into the last undecided relegation spot. Needing only a tie against Catania, a direct competitor in the relegation battle, Chievo lost 2–0 playing on a neutral field in Bologna. Wins by Parma, Siena and Reggina condemned Chievo to Serie B for the 2007–08 season after six seasons in the senior league.Even as a relatively successful Serie A team the club, which averages only 4-5000 fans and is kept afloat mainly by money from television rights, does not have the same level of fan support as Hellas – the real "Gialloblu" team of Verona. The difference between the clubs is high-lighted during local derby games played at the clubs shared stadium when, for Chievos "home" fixtures, the Chievo fans are located in away end of the stadium.== Bogdani the Grosseto left Lecce with one match remaining. In addition to winning promotion they were conferred with the "Ali della Vittoria" trophy on the final matchday of the season, their first league title of any kind in fourteen years.== Parma boss Lazio (who Juventus in Inter and Genoa in the final stretch of the season solidified Ceos position outside the drop zone and Serie A status was finally confirmed on matchday 37 with a home draw against Bologna F.C.|Bologna. A largely unchanged lineup earned safety the following season with 4 matchdays to spare, and Chievo is therefore a part of the inaugural Lega Calcio Serie A in 2010–11, their third consecutive season (and ninth season in the last ten years) in the top flight of Italian football.                                 ==              30   Jason Mayélé, Midfielder#Winger|left/right winger, 2001–2002 (posthumous) See Also:       ;Players with more than 100 league appearances with club*   Eugenio Corini*   Maurizio DAngelo*   Federico Cossato*   Lorenzo DAnna*   Daniele Franceschini*   Andrea Guerra*   Salvatore Lanna*   Marco Malagò*   Massimo Marazzina*   Dario Passoni*   Sergio Pellissier (current)*   Franco Semioli*   Andrea Zanchetta Luciano (current) ;2006 FIFA World Cup winner*   Andrea Barzagli*   Simone Barone*   Simone Perrotta;Internationals Players (Players in bold received call-up during at Chievo)*   Roberto Baronio*   Matteo Brighi*   Bernardo Corradi*   Stefano Fiore*   Federico Giunti*   Antonio Langella*   Nicola Legrottaglie*   Massimo Marazzina*   Luca Marchegiani*   Flavio Roma*   Franco Semioli*   Luciano Zauri*   Sergio Pellissier continued *   Erjon Bogdani*   Mario Santana*   César Prates*   Mauricio Pinilla*   Mario Yepes*   Jason Mayélé*   Christian Manfredini*   Saša Bjelanović*   Oliver Bierhoff*   John Mensah*   Ivan Fatić*   Stephen Makinwa*   Victor Nsofor Obinna*   Kamil Kosowski*   Bogdan Pătraşcu*   Nikola Lazetić*   Kewullay Conteh Daniel Andersson Michael Bradley    Alberto Malesani (1995–97)*   Domenico Caso (1998–00)*   Luigi Delneri (2000–04)*   Mario Beretta (2004–05)*   Giuseppe Pillon (2005–06)*   Luigi Delneri (2006–07)*   Giuseppe Iachini (2007–08)*   Domenico Di Carlo (2008–10)*   Stefano Pioli (2010–11)*   Domenico Di Carlo (2011–) The clubs original colours were blue and white and not the current blue and yellow. The clubs historic nickname is gialloblu (from the club colors of yellow and blue) although throughout Italian football the team recognised by most fans as "Gialloblu" are the original team from Verona – "Hellas Verona".  The club is more often referred to today as the mussi volanti ("flying donkeys" in the Verona dialect of Venetian language|Venetian). Local supporters often call the club simply Ceo, which is Veronese for Chievo. The "flying donkeys" nickname was originally a derogatory term from a match chant sung by fans from crosstown rivals Hellas Verona, which said that "donkeys would fly before Chievo made it to Serie A". However, with later successes by Chievo and contemporaneous Serie B and Serie C1 struggles for Hellas Verona, Chievo fans have now largely embraced the nickname as a badge of honour.The current club crest represents Cangrande I della Scala, an ancient seignor from Verona. At the end of the 2008/09 season, Chievo had an average crowd attendance of 13,352.  *</body></html>
