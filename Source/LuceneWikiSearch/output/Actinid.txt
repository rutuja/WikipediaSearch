Actinidedropped on Nagasaki had a plutonium charge. ]] IUPAC nomenclature) series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103, actinium through lawrencium.      The actinide series derives its name from the group 3 element actinium.  All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell; lawrencium, a d-block element, is also generally considered an actinide. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence (chemistry)|valence.{| class="wikitable"|- style="background: #ef99cc" Ac| Th| Pa| U| Np| Pu| Am| Cm| Bk| Cf| Es| Fm| Md| No| Lr|} transmutation reactions in uranium ores. The other actinides are purely synthetic elements.  Greenwood, p. 1250   Nuclear weapons tests have released at least six of these synthetic actinides into the natural environment|environment; analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium and fermium. All actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table,  with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively.

Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The most abundant, or easy to synthesize actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium and neptunium. The existence of transuranium elements was suggested by Enrico Fermi based on his experiments in 1934.   However, even though four actinides were known by that time, it was not yet understood that they formed a family similar to lanthanides. The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period hafnium, tantalum and tungsten, respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period neighbor, platinum, can reach oxidation state of 7) prompted Glenn Seaborg to formulate a so-called "actinide hypothesis". Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase "actinide hypothesis" (the implication being that "hypothesis" is something thats not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s.  At present, there are two major methods of producing  s or accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.  underground nuclear explosions. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with mass number greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half-life|half-lives of Alpha-decay|Î±-decay. This inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and nuclear fission. ==  suggested the existence of transuranium elements in 1934.]] pitchblende ore. He named it after the planet Uranus (planet)|Uranus,  which had been discovered only eight years earlier. Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. He then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal, and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal.  Only 60 years later, the French scientist EugÃ¨ne-Melchior PÃ©ligot identified it with uranium oxide. He also isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium.  The atomic mass of uranium was then calculated as 120, but Dmitri Mendeleev in 1872 corrected it to 240 using his periodicity laws. This value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by K. Zimmerman.   Norse god of thunder and lightning Thor.   The same isolation method was later used by PÃ©ligot for uranium.  title = first = last = journal = volume = issue = pages = 290â€“308 year = jstor = 229943}}  and 2000,  arguing that Debiernes publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899â€“1900. The name for word actinium comes from the Greek aktis, aktinos (Î±ÎºÏ„Î¯Ï‚, Î±ÎºÏ„Î¯Î½Î¿Ï‚), meaning beam or ray. This metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Golub, p. 213     Owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by Victor Goldschmidt in 1937.    author = title = journal = year = volume = 14 pages = Greek Ï€Ï�á¿¶Ï„Î¿Ï‚ + á¼€ÎºÏ„Î¯Ï‚ meaning "first beam element") in 1918 when two groups of scientists, led by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered  231 Pa. The name was shortened to Protactinium in 1949. This element was little characterized until 1960, when A. G. Maddock and co-workers in UK produced 130&nbsp;grams of protactinium from 60 tonnes of waste left after extraction of uranium from its ore. Greenwood, p. 1251 Neptunium (named for the planet Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was discovered by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 in Berkeley, California.    They produced the  239 Np isotope (half-life 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons.  It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically.   ==  and his group at the University of California at Berkeley synthesized Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No and element 106, which was later named seaborgium in his honor while he was still living. They also developed more than 100 atomic actinide isotopes.]]Transuranium elements do not occur in sizeable quantities in nature and are commonly synthesized via nuclear reactions conducted with nuclear reactors. For example, under irradiation with reactor neutrons, uranium-238 partially converts to plutonium-239::  \mathrm{ {}^{238}_{92}U + {}^{1}_{0}n\ \xrightarrow\ \ {}^{239}_{92}U\ \xrightarrow {\beta^-}\ {}^{239}_{93}Np\ \xrightarrow {\beta^-}\ {}^{239}_{94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {\alpha} }  used in nuclear weapons.  Actinides with the highest mass numbers are synthesized by bombarding uranium, plutonium, curium and californium with ions of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, neon or boron in a particle accelerator. So, nobelium was produced by bombarding uranium-238 with neon-22 as:  ~\mathrm{{}_{~92}^{238}{}U+{}_{10}^{22}{}Ne \longrightarrow {}_{102}^{256}{}No+4{}_0^1{}n} .First isotopes of transplutonium elements, americium-241 and curium-242, were synthesized in 1944 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James and Albert Ghiorso.  Curium-242 was obtained by bombarding plutonium-239 with 32-MeV Î±-particles:  ~\mathrm{{}_{~94}^{239}{}Pu+{}_2^4{}He \longrightarrow {}_{~96}^{242}{}Cm+{}_0^1{}n} . Pierre who are noted for discovering radium and for their work in radioactivity. Bombarding curium-242 with Î±-particles resulted in an isotope of californium Californium-245| 245 Cf (1950), and a similar procedure yielded in 1949 berkelium-243 from americium-241.  The new elements were named after Berkeley, California, by analogy with its lanthanide homologue terbium, which was named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden.    In 1945, B. B. Cunningham obtained the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide.  Over the next three to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949)   and californium (Thomson, 1950).      Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson),  and the first californium compound (0.3&nbsp;Âµg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann).  title = New Elements Einsteinium and Fermium, Atomic Numbers 99 and 100 volume = 99 doi = pages = year = 1955 bibcode = 1955PhRv...99.1048G }}   Nevertheless, the Berkeley team were able to prepare einsteinium and fermium by civilian means, through the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239, and published this work in 1954 with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements.    The "Ivy Mike" studies were declassified and published in 1955.  The first significant (submicrograms) amounts of einsteinium were produced in 1961 by Cunningham and colleagues, but this has not been done for fermium yet.   The first isotope of mendelevium, mendelevium-256| 256 Md (half-life 87 min), was synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory R. Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey and Stanley G. Thompson when they bombarded an  253 Es target with alpha particles in the 60-inch cyclotron of Berkeley Radiation Laboratory; this was the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time.   There were several attempts to obtain isotopes of nobelium by Swedish (1957) and American (1958) groups, but the first reliable results was the synthesis of Nobelium-256| 256 No by the Russian group (Georgy Flyorov et al.) in 1965, as acknowledges by the IUPAC in 1992. In their experiments, Flyorov et al. bombarded uranium-238 with neon-22. In 1961, Ghiorso et al. obtained the first isotope of lawrencium by irradiating californium (mostly californium-252) with boron-10 and boron-11 ions.  The mass number of this isotope was not clearly established (possibly 258 or 259) at the time. In 1965, Lawrencium-256| 256 Lr were synthesized by Flyorov et al. from Americium-243| 243 Am and oxygen-18| 18 O. Thus IUPAC recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.{| Class = "wikitable collapsible collapsed" style = "text-align: center"|+ Nuclear properties of isotopes of the most important transplutonium isotopes   |- Isotope! rowspan = "2"|Half-life Probability of Emission energy, MeV (yield in%)|| colspan = "2 "| Specific activity  of|-!

All the isotopes have short lifetime, except for protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years). The most important isotopes are  231 Pa and protactinium-233| 233 Pa, which is an intermediate product in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of protactinium.  233 Pa has convenient half-life and energy of Gamma radiation|Î³-radiation, and thus was used in most studies of protactinium chemistry. Protactinium-233 is a Beta radiation|Î²-emitter with a half-life of 26.97 days.  Uranium has the highest number (25) of both natural and synthetic Isotopes of uranium|isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217â€“242,  and three of them, Uranium-234| 234 U,  235 U and  238 U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, the most important is  233 U, which is a final product of transformations of Thorium-232| 232 Th irradiated by slow neutrons.  233 U has a very higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with  235 U. Most uranium chemistry studies were carried out on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4  years.   There are 19 isotopes of neptunium with mass numbers from 225 to 244;  they are all highly radioactive. The most popular among scientists are long-lived  237 Np (t Â½  = 2.20  years) and short-lived  239 Np,  238 Np (t Â½  ~ 2 days). Sixteen isotopes of americium are known with mass numbers from 232 to 248.  The most important are  241 Am and  243 Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense Î³-rays; both of them can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with  241 Am, but later shifted to  243 Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of  243 Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope  239 Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis. Myasoedov, p. 18 Among 19 isotopes of curium,  the most accessible are  242 Cm and  244 Cm; they are Î±-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no Î³-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission with the associated emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium ( 245â€“248 Cm, all Î±-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by curium-246, and then curium-248 begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially  248 Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48  years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than  242 Cm and  244 Cm, but they also have a rather high rate of spontaneous fission.  247 Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56  years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.Fourteen isotopes of berkelium were identified with mass numbers 238â€“252.  Only  249 Bk is available in large quantities; it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft Beta decay|Î²-particles, which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak (1.45 % with respect to Î²-radiation), but is sometimes used to detect this isotope.  247 Bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years, but it is hard to obtain in appreciable quantities; it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the Î²-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with mass number below 248. Isotopes of californium with mass numbers 237â€“256 are formed in nuclear reactors;  californium-253 is a Î²-emitter and the rest are Î±-emitters. The isotopes with even mass numbers ( 250 Cf,  252 Cf and  254 Cf) have a high rate of spontaneous fission, especially  254 Cf of which 99.7% decays by spontaneous fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak spontaneous fission and strong Î³-emission that facilitates its identification.  249 Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow Î²-decay of the parent isotope  249 Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the Î²-decay product of (pre-selected)  249 Bk. Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of  250 Cf and  252 Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.

It is an Î±-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days, a relatively weak Î³-emission and small spontaneous fission rate as compared with the isotopes of californium. Prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a long-lived isotope  254 Es (t Â½  = 275.5 days). Nineteen isotopes of fermium are known with mass numbers of 242â€“260.  254 Fm,  255 Fm and  256 Fm are Alpha radiation|Î±-emitters with a short half-life (hours), which can be isolated in significant amounts.  257 Fm (t Â½  = 100 days) can accumulate upon prolonged and strong irradiation. All these isotopes are characterized by high rates of spontaneous fission.    Among the 15 known isotopes of mendelevium (mass numbers from 245 to 260),  the most studied is  256 Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (Î±-radiation is â‰ˆ10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter,  258 Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium ( 253 Es and  255 Es respectively), that limits their so their availability. Long-lived isotopes of nobelium and isotopes of lawrencium (and of heavier elements) have relatively small half-lives. For nobelium 11 isotopes are known with mass numbers 250â€“260 and 262. Chemical properties of nobelium and lawrencium were studied with  255 No (t Â½  = 3 min) and  256 Lr (t Â½  = 35 s). The longest-lived nobelium isotope  259 No has a half-life of 1.5 hours.  Thorium and uranium are the most abundant actinides in nature with the respective mass concentrations of 1.6 % and 4 %.  Uranium mostly occurs in the Earths crust as a mixture of its oxides in the minerals   such as carnotite (KUO 2 VO 4 Â·3H 2 O) and autunite (Ca(UO 2 ) 2 (PO 4 ) 2 Â·nH 2 O). The isotopic composition of natural uranium is Uranium-238| 238 U (relative abundance 99.2742%), Uranium-235| 235 U (0.7204%) and Uranium-234| 234 U (0.0054%); of these  238 U has the largest half-life of 4.51  years.     The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 tonnes, of which 27.3% was mined in Kazakhstan.

Most thorium minerals contain uranium and vice versa; and they all have significant fraction of lanthanides. Rich deposits of thorium minerals are located in the United States (440,000 tonnes), Australia and India (~300,000 tonnes each) and Canada (~100,000 tonnes). The abundance of actinium in the Earths crust is only about 5 %.  Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope  235 U, and it is not affected by the weak Ac migration.  Protactinium is more abundant (10 âˆ’12 %) in the Earths crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and GÃ¶hring.  As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of  235 U. The half-life of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, Neptunium-237| 237 Np, is negligible compared to the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.  Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on  239 Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium,  244 Pu, is 3 %. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced synthetically.  Owing to the low abundance of actinides, their extraction is a complex, multistep process. Fluorides of actinides are usually used because they are insoluble in water and can be easily separated with redox reactions. Fluorides are reduced with calcium, magnesium or barium: Golub, pp. 215â€“217 :  ~\mathrm{2AmF_3+3Ba \ \xrightarrow{1150-1350^\circ C} \ 3BaF_2+2Am} :  ~\mathrm{PuF_4+2Ba \ \xrightarrow{1200^\circ C} \ 2BaF_2+Pu} :  ~\mathrm{UF_4+2Mg \ \xrightarrow{>500^\circ C} \ U+2MgF_2} Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are the easiest to isolate.

Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process. Uranium is extracted from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution with a solution of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO 2 (NO 3 ) 2 (TBP) 2 . The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium is extracted by reaction with hydroxides as (NH 4 ) 2 U 2 O 7  or with hydrogen peroxide as UO 4 Â·2H 2 O.  corrosivity (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure::2 UO 2  + O 2  + 6 CO 3  2â€“  â†’ 2   4â€“ This equation suggests that the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing is a mixture of carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate. Another separation method uses polymeric resins as a polyelectrolyte. Ion exchange processes in the resins result in separation of uranium. Uranium from resins is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate or nitric acid that yields uranyl nitrate, UO 2 (NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O. When heated, it turns into UO 3 , which is converted to UO 2  with hydrogen:: UO 3  + H 2  â†’ UO 2  + H 2 OReacting uranium dioxide with fluoric acid changes it to uranium tetrafluoride, which yields uranium metal upon reaction with magnesium metal: : 4 HF + UO 2  â†’ UF 4  + 2 H 2 O FeSO 4 H 2 O 2 ) is added to the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO 2 (NO 3 ) 2 ). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu 4+  compounds. In another method, Pu 4+ and UO 2  2+  are first extracted with tributyl phosphate, then reacted with hydrazine washing out the recovered plutonium. The major difficulty in separation of actinium is the similarity of its properties with those of lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures. Actinides have similar properties to lanthanides. The 6d-block|d and 7s-block|s electronic shells are completed in actinium and thorium, and the 5f-block|f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell is filled in the lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940.    As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).

Actinides, especially those with a small number of 5f-electrons, are prone to Hybridization (chemistry)|hybridization. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides. Golub, pp. 222â€“227  basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac 3+  is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.  Thorium is rather active chemically. Owing to lack of electrons on 6d-and 4f-orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH  2 O) 8 ] 4+ . The Th 4+  ion is relatively large, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Ã…. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency to a hydrolysis. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents. Protactinium exhibits two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions is obtained by the action of strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element. Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, the last being most stable. In the hexavalent state, uranium is very similar to the sixth group elements. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are nonstoichiometric, i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO 2+x , where x varies between âˆ’0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak Oxidizing agent|oxidants. Most of them contain the linear "uranyl" group, UO 2  2+ . Between 4 to 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. NpO 2  2+  and PuO 2  2+  are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms organometallic compounds, such as U III (C 5 H 5 ) 3  and U IV (C 5 H 5 ) 4 .  Greenwood, p. 1278 Neptunium has valence states from 3 to 7, which can be simultaneously observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds. Plutonium also exhibits the valence between 3 and 7, and thus is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25â€“50 Â°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.    The largest chemical diversity among actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, but also in the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds. Myasoedov, pp. 25â€“29  Ce 4+ . Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids. The redox potential  ~E_\frac{M^{4+}}{AnO^{2+}_{2}}  increases from âˆ’0.32 V in uranium, through 0.34 V (Np) and 1.04 V (Pu) to 1.34 V in americium revealing the increasing reduction ability of the An 4+  ion from americium to uranium. All actinides form AnH 3  hydrides of black color with salt-like properties. Actinides also produce carbides with the general formula of AnC or AnC 2  (U 2 C 3  for uranium) as well as sulfides An 2 S 3  and AnS 2 .    Uranyl nitrate (UO 2 (NO 3 ) 2 ).

This oxide is amphoteric and forms several hydroxides, the most stable being UO 2 (OH) 2 .Reaction of uranium(VI) oxide with hydrogen results in uranium dioxide, which is similar in its properties with ThO 2 . This oxide is also basic and corresponds to the uranium hydroxide (U(OH) 4 ). Plutonium, neptunium and americium form two basic oxides: An 2 O 3  and AnO 2 . Neptunium trioxide is unstable, thus only Np 3 O 8  could be obtained so far. However, the oxides of plutonium and neptunium with the chemical formula AnO 2  and An 2 O 3  are well characterized. == {| Class = "wikitable collapsible collapsed" style = "text-align: center"|+ Trichlorides of some actinides  Greenwood, p. 1270 |- Chemical formula| AcCl 3 || UCl 3 || NpCl 3 || PuCl 3 || AmCl 3 || CmCl 3 || BkCl 3 || CfCl 3 |-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|CAS-number| 22986-54-5|| 10025-93-1|| 20737-06-8|| 13569-62-5|| 13464-46-5|| 13537-20-7|| 13536-46-4|| 13536-90-8|- PubChem|||  |||||||||||||- Molar mass| 333.386 || 344.387 || 343.406 || 350.32 || 349.42 || 344â€“358**|| 353.428 || 357.438|- Melting point 800 Â°C||767 715 Â°C||695 603 Â°C||545 Â°C|- Boiling point 1767 Â°C||850 Â°C|| || |||- Crystal structure| Colspan = "8"|  An 3+ :  __ &nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;Cl âˆ’ :  __ |- Space group P6 3 /m|- Coordination number| Colspan = "8" |An* , Cl  |- Lattice constants pm  c = 455 pm|| a = 745.2 pm  c = 432.8 pm|| || a = 739.4 pm  c = 424.3 pm|| a = 738.2 pm  c = 421.4 pm|| a = 726 pm  c = 414 pm|| a = 738.2 pm  c = 412.7 pm|| a = 738 pm   c = 409 pm|}:   *An â€“ actinide  **Depending on the isotopes {| Class = "wikitable collapsible collapsed" style = "text-align: center"|+ Actinide fluorides       |- Compound!

Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO 2 F 2 . Greenwood, p.1269  Pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable. Action of acids on actinides yields salts, and if the acids are non-oxidizing then the actinide in the salt is in low-valence state:: U + 2 H 2 SO 4  â†’ U (SO 4 ) 2  + 2 H 2 : 2 Pu + 6 HCl â†’ 2 PuCl 3  + 3 H 2 However, in these reactions the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal, forming the corresponding hydride. Uranium reacts with acids and water much easier than thorium. Actinide salts can also be obtained by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO 3 ) 4 Â·6H 2 O, Th(SO 4 ) 2 Â·9H 2 O and Pu 2 (SO 4 ) 3 Â·7H 2 O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH) 2 SO 4  and Th(OH) 3 NO 3 . The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF 4 Â·3H 2 O and Th(CrO 4 ) 2 Â·3H 2 O. Actinides with oxidation state +6, except for the AnO 2  2+ -type cations, form   2â€“ ,   2â€“  and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na 2 UO 4  (uranate) and (NH 4 ) 2 U 2 O 7  (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides easier form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K 2 ThF 6 , KThF 5 , and even K 5 ThF 9  complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na 2 SO 4 Â·Th (SO 4 ) 2 Â·5H 2 O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An 2 Th(NO 3 ) 6 Â·nH 2 O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides â€“ tetravalent thorium and uranium â€“ are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.   containing americium-241.]] fuel in chain reaction. .]]The most important isotope for nuclear power applications is uranium-235. It is used in the thermal reactor, and its concentration in natural uranium does not exceed 0.72%. This isotope strongly absorbs thermal neutrons releasing much energy. One fission act of 1&nbsp;gram of  235 U converts into about 1 MWÂ·day. Of importance, is that  235 U emits more neutrons than it absorbs; Golub, pp. 220â€“221  upon reaching the critical mass,  235 U enters into a self-sustaining chain reaction.    Typically, uranium nucleus is divided into two fragments with the release of 2â€“3 neutrons, for example::  ~\mathrm{{}_{~}^{235}U+ \ ^1_0n \longrightarrow {}_{~}^{115}Rh+{}_{~}^{118}Ag + 3^1_0n} Other promising actinide isotopes for nuclear power are thorium-232 and its fission product, formed uranium-233.{| class="wikitable"  style="float:right; width:40%;"|-  style="background:lightblue; text-align:center;"| Nuclear reactor   |-|   The core of any nuclear reactor contains a set of hollow metal rods, usually made of zirconium alloys, filled with nuclear fuel cells â€“ mostly oxide, carbide, nitride or monosulfide of uranium, plutonium or thorium, or their mixture (the so-called MOX fuel). The most common fuel is oxide of uranium-235.  Fast neutrons are slowed by Moderator (Nuclear Reactor)|moderators, which contain water, carbon, deuterium, or beryllium, as thermal neutrons to increase the efficiency of their interaction with uranium-235. The rate of nuclear reaction is controlled by introducing additional rods made of boron or cadmium or a liquid absorbent, usually boric acid. Reactors for plutonium production are called breeder reactor or breeders; they have a different design and use fast neutrons. |}Emission of neutrons during the fission of uranium is important not only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction, but also for the synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via Beta decay|Î²-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The worlds first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.About half of the produced thorium is used as the light-emitting material of gas mantles.  Thorium is also added into multicomponent  ).  critical mass to about a third of that for uranium-235.   (See also Nuclear weapon design.) Hypothetically, as little as 4&nbsp;kg of plutoniumâ€”and maybe even lessâ€”could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.    Galileo and Apollo spacecrafts (e.g. Apollo 14 ) had heaters powered by kilogram quantities of plutonium-238 oxide; this heat is also transformed into electricity with thermopiles. The decay of plutonium-238 is produced relatively harmless alpha particles and is not accompanied by gamma-irradiation. Therefore and this isotope (~160&nbsp;mg) is used as the energy source in heart pacemakers where it lasts about 5 times longer than conventional batteries. Actinium-227 is used as a neutron source. Its high specific energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use.  228 Ac is used as an indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. Actinium-228| 228 Ac-Radium-228| 228 Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.   Periodic table with elements colored according to the half-life of their most stable isotope.      ]]Radioactive substances can harm human health via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by Beta particle|Î²-activity and Gamma ray|Î³-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium is one of the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific Alpha radiation|Î±-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium. Protactinium in the body tends to accumulate in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of Pa in the human body is 0.03 Curie (unit)|ÂµCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of  231 Pa. This isotope, which might be present in the air as aerosol, is 2.5  times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid. Plutonium, when entering the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium in the body is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing Î±-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22&nbsp;mg for a person weighing 70&nbsp;kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5&nbsp;Âµg or 0.3 ÂµCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65&nbsp;Âµg or 0.04 ÂµCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous Pu exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5â€“25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, Pu is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, and the rest is excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.    Actinides in the environment*Lanthanides  * *  *  * *
