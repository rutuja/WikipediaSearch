Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial propaganda. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honour of the citys anniversary, in 48 Anno Domini|AD, 800 years after the founding of the city. Hadrian and Antoninus Pius held similar celebrations, in 121 AD and 147/148 AD respectively.In 248 AD, Philip the Arab celebrated Romes first millennium, together with Ludi saeculares for Romes alleged tenth saeculum. Coins from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, Pacatianus, explicitly states "Year one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the Empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a Saeculum Novum. metaphysical sense, and removed legal impediments to the development and public use of the Anno Domini dating system, which came into general use during the reign of Charlemagne.The traditional date for the founding of Rome of 21 April 753 BC, was initiated by Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro. Varro may have used the consular list with its mistakes, and called the year of the first consuls "245 ab urbe condita", accepting the 244-year interval from Dionysius of Halicarnassus for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of Varros calculation has not been proved scientifically but is still used worldwide. Roman consuls) that the year 1 AD corresponds to the Roman year DCCLIV ab urbe condita, based on Varros epoch. This however resulted in that year not corresponding with the lifetimes of historical figures reputed to be alive, or otherwise mentioned in connection with the Christian incarnation, e.g. Herod the Great or Publius Sulpicius Quirinius|Quirinius. :...1 ab urbe condita = 753 before Christ:2 AUC = 752 BC:3 AUC = 751 BC ...:750 AU = 4 BC (Death of Herod the Great):751 AU = 3 BC:752 AU = 2 BC:753 AU = 1 BC:754 AU = 1 Anno Domini:755 AU = 2 AD:759 AU = 6 AD (Quirinius becomes governor of Syria) ...:2753 AU = 2000 AD:2765 AU = 2012 AD capture of Troy (1182 BC). It took place shortly before an eclipse of the Sun that was observed at Rome on 25 June 745 BC and had a magnitude of 50.3%. Its beginning occurred at 16:38, its middle at 17:28, and its end at 18:16. Dio (Dion) Cassius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (L. 2). Dio in his Roman History (Book I) confirms this data by telling that Romulus was in his 18th year of age when he had founded Rome. Thus, three eclipse calculations may support the suggestion that Romulus reigned from 746 BC to 709 BC, and Rome was founded in 745 BC. Xerxes crossed over to Greece, and that event is fixed to 478 BC by two solar eclipses.  List of Latin phrases
