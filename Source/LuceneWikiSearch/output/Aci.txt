Acid, a typical metal, reacting with hydrochloric acid, a typical acid]]An acid (from the Latin acidus/acÄ“re meaning sour ) is a substance which reacts with a Base (chemistry)|base. Commonly, acids can be identified as tasting sour, reacting with metals such as calcium, and bases like sodium carbonate. Aqueous acids have a pH of less than 7, where an acid of lower pH is typically stronger. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic. car batteries), and tartaric acid (used in baking). As these three examples show, acids can be solutions, liquids, or solids. Gases such as hydrogen chloride can be acids as well. Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive substance|corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid. moles per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have pHs of less than 7. By the BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid. Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.In chemistry, the Lewis definition of acidity is frequently encountered. Lewis acids are electron-pair acceptors. Examples of Lewis acids include all metal ion|cations, and electron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride. Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry acids as mentioned above, they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.== hydroxide (OH âˆ’ ) ions: Ebbing, D.D., & Gammon, S. D. (2005). General chemistry (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-618-51177-6 : H 2 O(l) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + OH âˆ’ (aq) base is a molecule which increases the concentration of the hydroxide ion when dissolved in water. Note that chemists often write H + (aq) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H 3 O +  .==While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists Johannes Nicolaus BrÃ¸nsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry acid (or simply BrÃ¸nsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry base.  BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste::  molecular compounds, ionic compounds. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride, NH 4 Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrheniuss definition:# H 3 O + (aq) + Cl âˆ’ (aq) + NH 3  â†’ Cl âˆ’ (aq) + NH 4  + (aq)# HCl(benzene) + NH 3 (benzene) â†’ NH 4 Cl(s)# HCl(g) + NH 3 (g) â†’ NH 4 Cl(s)As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in benzene) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH 3  combine to form the solid.==A third concept was proposed in 1923 by Gilbert N. Lewis which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A Lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.  BrÃ¸nsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. All BrÃ¸nsted acids are also Lewis acids, but not all Lewis acids are BrÃ¸nsted acids. Contrast the following reactions which could be described in terms of acid-base chemistry.:  fluoride ion, electron pair nuclei and oxidizer or an electrophile.The BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H + ) from an acid to a base. conjugate base. equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant K is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that   means the concentration of H 2 O. The acid dissociation constant K a  is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of K a  is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H + .: K_a = \frac{   }{ } The stronger of two acids will have a higher K a  than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for K a  spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pK a  is more frequently used, where pK a  = -log 10  K a . Stronger acids have a smaller pK a  than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pK a  at 25&nbsp;Â°C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their anions. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid. In the IUPAC naming system, "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.Classical naming system:{|border="1" cellpadding="4" align="center" cellspacing="0" style="background: #f9f9f9; color: black; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;"!Anion prefix!Anion suffix!Acid prefix!Acid suffix!Example|- per|ate per|ic acid perchloric acid (HClO 4 )|-| ate| ic acid chloric acid (HClO 3 )|-| ite| ous acid chlorous acid (HClO 2 )|- hypo|ite hypo|ous acid hypochlorous acid (HClO)|-| ide|hydro ic acid hydrochloric acid (HCl)|}  mole of polarity of the Hâ€”A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the Hâ€”A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.Stronger acids have a larger K a  and a more negative pK a  than weaker acids.Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.Superacids are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid, magic acid and perchloric acid. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline hydronium "salts". They can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations.== dissociation (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA)::::::HA(aq) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + A âˆ’ (aq) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K a Common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO 3 ). On the other hand, for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in organic acids include formic acid (HCOOH), acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) and benzoic acid (C 6 H 5 COOH). ==Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H 2 A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K a1  and K a2 .:::::H 2 A(aq) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + HA âˆ’ (aq) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K a1 :::::HA âˆ’ (aq) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + A 2âˆ’ (aq)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; K a2 The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., K a1  > K a2 . For example, sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (HSO 4  âˆ’ ), for which K a1  is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (SO 4  2- ), wherein the K a2  is intermediate strength. The large K a1  for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (HCO 3  âˆ’ ) and lose a second to form carbonate anion (CO 3  2- ). Both K a  values are small, but K a1  > K a2  .A triprotic acid (H 3 A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where K a1  > K a2  > K a3 .:::::H 3 A(aq) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + H 2 A âˆ’ (aq) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; K a1 :::::H 2 A âˆ’ (aq) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + HA 2âˆ’ (aq) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K a2 :::::HA 2âˆ’ (aq) + H 2 O(l)   H 3 O + (aq) + A 3âˆ’ (aq) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K a3  organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid, which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion. Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive K a  values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, Î± (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H 2 A, HA - , and A 2- . The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the  ) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases: \alpha_{H_2 A}= =    \alpha_{HA^- }= =    \alpha_{A^{2-}}= =   A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n -protic acid that has been deprotonated i -times: \alpha_{H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{ ^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \over { \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^n \Big ^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \Big] } where K 0  = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid. ==  (in beaker (glassware)|beaker) reacting with ammonia fumes to produce ammonium chloride (white smoke).]] Neutralization is salt and neutralized base; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water:::HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) â†’ H 2 O(l) + NaCl(aq)Neutralization is the basis of titration, where a pH indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride, which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide.== In order to lose a proton, it is necessary that the pH of the system rise above the pK a  of the protonated acid. The decreased concentration of H +  in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H +  concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form, or to protonate its conjugate base (the deprotonated form).Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions.There are numerous uses for acids. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling (metal)|pickling. They may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery, such as sulfuric acid in a car battery.Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing. For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning. esterified with alcohols, to produce esters.Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. Phosphoric acid, for example, is a component of cola drinks. Acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar. Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.Tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. Citric acid is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. Oxalic acid is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in carambola and rhubarb; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin required in our body and is present in such foods as amla, lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.Certain acids are used as drugs. Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.Acids play very important roles in the human body. The hydrochloric acid present in our stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of our body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA, RNA and transmission of characters to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.==  dehydration and condensation reactions. In biochemistry, many enzymes employ acid catalysis.    phosphate groups, include DNA and RNA. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits. Cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids.An Î±-amino acid has a central carbon (the Î± or alpha carbon) which is covalently bonded to a  . Peptidoglycan, found in some bacterial cell walls contains some  D -amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO âˆ’ ) and the basic amine group (-NH 2 ) gains a proton (-NH 3  + ). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion, with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. Aspartic acid, for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of -1 at physiological pH.Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer, a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic phosphate "head" groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.In humans and many other animals, hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, pepsinogen into the digestive enzyme|enzyme, pepsin. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce formic acid. Oxygen gas (O 2 ) drives cellular respiration, the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food, producing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs, and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation (physiology)|ventilation. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat, releasing CO 2  into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO 2  exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion.: CO 2  + H 2 O   H 2 CO 3    H +  + HCO 3  âˆ’ It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO 2  and resupplying the cells with O 2 . lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and cytosol, both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the intracellular pH will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. Ibuprofen, aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids.==* Hydrogen halides and their solutions: hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid (HI)* Halogen oxoacids: hypochlorous acid (HClO), chlorous acid (HClO 2 ), chloric acid (HClO 3 ), perchloric acid (HClO 4 ), and corresponding compounds for bromine and iodine* Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 )* Fluorosulfuric acid (HSO 3 F)* Nitric acid (HNO 3 )* Phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 )* Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF 6 )* Fluoroboric acid (HBF 4 )* Hexafluorophosphoric acid (HPF 6 )* Chromic acid (H 2 CrO 4 )* Boric acid (H 3 BO 3 )==* Methanesulfonic acid (or mesylic acid, CH 3 SO 3 H)* Ethanesulfonic acid (or esylic acid, CH 3 CH 2 SO 3 H)* Benzenesulfonic acid (or besylic acid, C 6 H 5 SO 3 H)* p-Toluenesulfonic acid (or tosylic acid, CH 3 C 6 H 4 SO 3 H)* Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (or triflic acid, CF 3 SO 3 H)* Polystyrene sulfonic acid (sulfonated polystyrene,   n )==* Acetic acid (CH 3 COOH)* Citric acid (C 6 H 8 O 7 )* Formic acid (HCOOH)* Gluconic acid HOCH 2 -(CHOH) 4 -COOH* Lactic acid (CH 3 -CHOH-COOH)* Oxalic acid (HOOC-COOH)* Tartaric acid (HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH)==* Ascorbic acid* Meldrums acid==* Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)* Ribonucleic acid (RNA);Chemistry* Acid-base extraction* Acid value* Acid salt Base* Basic salt* Binary acid* Hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB theory)* Titration* Vitriol;Environment* Acid rain* Acid sulfate soil* Ocean acidification  *  * Zumdahl, Chemistry, 4th Edition.* Ebbing, D.D., & Gammon, S.
