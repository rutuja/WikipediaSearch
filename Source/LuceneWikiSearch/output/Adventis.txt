Today, the largest church within the movement is the Seventh-day Adventist Church. unconscious sleep annihilation or heaven or one on earth.  The movement has encouraged the examination of the New Testament, leading them to observe the Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath. Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Millers predictions of Christs return. After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.  Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of Jesus). Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers". A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.   ==The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists". However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.  Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the Advent Christian Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.The largest group organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.  Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the Advent Herald,  of which Sylvester Bliss was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the Messiahâ€™s Herald. The Life and Advent Union was founded by George Storrs in the year of 1863. He had established The Bible Examiner in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964. The Advent Christian Church officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first. It declined a little over the 20th century.  The Advent Christians publish the four magazines The Advent Christian Witness, Advent Christian News, Advent Christian Missions and Maranatha. They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a Bible College at Lennox, Massachusetts.  The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.The Seventh-day Adventist Church officially formed in 1863.  It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.  It published the Adventist Review and Sabbath Herald.  It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.Miller did not join any of the movements, and spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.The Handbook of Denominations in the United States, 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches":== The Christadelphians, were founded in 1844 and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches in 2000 in America.==  The Advent Christian Church was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.
