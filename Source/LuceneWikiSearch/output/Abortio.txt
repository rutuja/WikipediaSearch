Abortion Abortion is defined as the termination of  . The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. developed world local law, among the contraceptive services has increased.    Forty percent of the worlds women have access to induced abortions (within gestational limits).     history and traditional methods. public controversy ethical and legal issues of abortion.  == unintended and about a fifth end in induced abortion.  Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.   Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor or patient preference. therapeutic abortion selectively reduce multiple pregnancy.     An abortion is referred to as an elective or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons. ==  week of gestation. Note that the defining line between miscarriage and premature birth or stillbirth varies among jurisdictions.    A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a live birth (human)|live-born infant is known as a "premature birth" or a "preterm birth".  When a fetus dies in utero after viability, or during childbirth|delivery, it is usually termed "stillbirth|stillborn".  Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.  aware of the conception,  and many pregnancies are lost before medical practitioners have the ability to detect the presence of an embryo.  Between 15% and 30% of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman. The most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo/fetus,       accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses.    Other causes include vascular disease (such as Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus.  Advancing maternal age and a patient history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion.  A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental Physical trauma|trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide.     may determine which abortion methods are practiced.]]==  analogs in antiprogestogen mifepristone in the 1980s.         The most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) up to 9 weeks gestational age, methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone.  Mifepristoneâ€“misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexateâ€“misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone. In very early abortions, up to 7 weeks gestation, medical abortion using a mifepristoneâ€“misoprostol combination regimen is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration), especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue.    Early medical abortion regimens using 200 mg of mifepristone, followed 24â€“48 hours later by 800 mcg of buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98% effective up to 9 weeks gestational age.  * The regimen (200 mg of mifepristone, followed 24â€“48 hours later by 800 mcg of vaginal misoprostol) previously used by Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States from 2001 to March 2006 was 98.5% effective through 63 days gestationâ€”with an ongoing pregnancy rate of about 0.5%, and an additional 1% of patients having uterine evacuation for various reasons, including problematic bleeding, persistent gestational sac, clinician judgment or patient request.* The regimen (200 mg of mifepristone, followed 24â€“48 hours later by 800 mcg of   misoprostol) currently used by Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States since April 2006 is 98.3% effective through 59 days gestation.  In cases of failure of medical abortion, surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure. Early medical abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in Britain,   France,  Switzerland,  and the Nordic countries.    In the United States, the percentage of early medical abortions is far lower.    Medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog are the most common methods used for second-trimester abortions in Canada, most of Europe, China and India,  in contrast to the United States where 96% of second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation. == In the first 15 weeks, suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common surgical method.  Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) abortion consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) abortion uses an electric pump. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "menstrual extraction", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Dilation and curettage (D&C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. Curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the uterus with a curette. The World Health Organization recommends this procedure, also called sharp curettage, only when MVA is unavailable.  amniotic fluid saline or federally banned in the United States.In the third trimester of pregnancy, abortion may be performed by IDX as described above, induction of labor, or by hysterotomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.    deep sedation or general anesthesia. == history of multiple organ failure, and is not recommended by physicians. Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage.  In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage.    One of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld. Reported methods of unsafe, self-induced abortion include misuse of misoprostol, and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These methods are rarely seen in developed countries where surgical abortion is legal and available.    developed world risk of maternal death from abortion in 1999 was 0.567 per 100,000 procedures, making abortion approximately 12.5 times safer than childbirth (7.06 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births).    The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with increasing gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks gestation.       primary care pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate.    Preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before elective abortion,  as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection.   Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen.There is little, if any, difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 9 weeks gestation.  Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion.  ==   developing countries.  Unsafe abortion is believed to result in approximately 68,000 deaths    and millions of injuries annually.  Groups such as the World Health Organization have advocated a public-health approach to addressing unsafe abortion, emphasizing the legalization of abortion, the training of medical personnel, and ensuring access to reproductive-health services.   Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly when access to legal abortion is restricted. They may attempt to self-induced abortion|self-abort or rely on another person who does not have proper medical training or access to proper facilities. This has a tendency to lead to severe complications, such as incomplete abortion, sepsis, hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs. The legality of abortion is one of the main determinants of its safety. Restrictive abortion laws are associated with a high rate of unsafe abortions.        For example, the 1996 legalization of abortion in South Africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion-related complications,    with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than 90%.    In addition, a lack of access to effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by as much as 73% without any change in abortion laws if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally. Singh, Susheela et al.   (New York: Guttmacher Institute and United Nations Population Fund 2009): "If womenâ€™s contraceptive needs were addressed (and assuming no changes in abortion laws)...the number of unsafe abortions would decline by 73% from 20 million to 5.5 million." A few of the findings in that report were subsequently changed, and are available at: " " (Guttmacher Institute 2010).  maternal mortality maternal mortalities worldwide,    though this varies by region.  Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women.  Although the global rate of abortion declined from 45.6 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003, unsafe procedures still accounted for 48% of all abortions performed in 2003.    Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon. ==  suggest that the interruption of normal breast development during pregnancy leaves immature cells that are more cancer-prone in the breasts. However, major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the US National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have all concluded on the basis of existing evidence that abortion does not cause breast cancer. *World Health Organization:  *National Cancer Institute:  *American Cancer Society:  *Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists:  *American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:    The concept of a causal link between induced abortion and breast cancer is promoted primarily by pro-life groups. == The current scientific consensus holds that there is no causal relationship between abortion and mental-health problems.    While women most frequently feel relieved after the procedure,  some factors in a womans life, such as emotional attachment to the pregnancy, lack of social support, or pre-existing psychiatric illness increase the likelihood of experiencing negative feelings after an abortion.    The American Psychological Association has concluded that a single abortion is not a threat to womens mental health, and that women are no more likely to have mental-health problems after a first-trimester abortion than after carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.     Similarly, abortions performed after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities are not thought to cause mental-health problems.   Some studies have disagreed with above conclusions; other researchers and professional organizations have noted that such studies typically fail to use appropriate comparison groups, do not adequately account for confounding variables, and improperly account for pre-existing mental health complications. For example of such studies and why researchers have criticized them, see:* * *   Some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by pro-life advocates as a separate condition called "post-abortion syndrome", which is not recognized by any medical or psychological organization. * * *  There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:* Abortion rate â€“ number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age* Abortion ratio â€“ number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (excluding miscarriages and stillbirths)The number of abortions performed worldwide has decreased between 1995 and 2003 from 45.6&nbsp;million to 41.6&nbsp;million, which means a decrease in abortion rate per annum from 35 to 29 per 1000 women.  The greatest decrease has occurred in the developed world with a drop from 39 to 26 per 1000 women in comparison to the developing world, which had a decrease from 34 to 29 per 1000 women.  In 2003, the estimated global abortion ratio was 31. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions which are performed unsafely.      The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide. The incidence of induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. The ratio of induced abortion ranges from ten to thirty percent; figures in the developing world vary widely and are often incomplete. ==  intrauterine instillation" hysterotomy and hysterectomy).    According to the CDC, due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.   The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the US during 2000; this accounts for 0.17% of the total number of abortions performed that year.  Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 to 19 weeks, and 1.5% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&E, and 30% were medical.  Later abortions are more common in China, India, and other developing countries than in developed countries. ==  meta-study on the reasons women stated for having an abortion.]]The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary dramatically across the world. Some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to a more suitable time or to focus energies and resources on existing children. Others include being unable to afford a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising a child or the loss of income while she is caring for the child, lack of support from the father, inability to afford additional children, desire to provide schooling for existing children, disruption of ones own education, relationship problems with their partner, a perception of being too young to have a child, and unemployment, among others.      An additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health, which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single-digit percentage of abortions in other countries.   Pregnancies caused as a result of incest or rape comprised less than 1.5% of abortions in a 2004 U.S. study.  contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the combined oral contraceptive pill|birth-control pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.  The Guttmacher Institute estimated that "most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women" because minority women "have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy." Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the stigmatization of disabled people, preference for children of a specific sex, disapproval of single or earl motherhood, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward population control (such as Chinas one-child policy). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex-selective abortion. .]] Induced abortion has long history, and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as China under Shennong (c. 2700 BCE), Ancient Egypt with its Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), and the Roman Empire in the time of Juvenal (c. 200 CE).    There is evidence to suggest that pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques. Ancient Greek Islamic tradition has traditionally permitted abortion up until a point in time when Muslims believe the soul enters the fetus,  considered by various theologians to be at conception, 40 days after conception, 120 days after conception, or quickening.    However, abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high Islamic faith such as the Middle East and North Africa. In Europe and North America, abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century. However, conservatism by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe abortion techniques.  Other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services, and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century, when the practice was banned in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  Church groups as well as physicians were highly influential in anti-abortion movements.  In the US, abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer. By 1930, medical procedures in the US had improved for both childbirth and abortion but not equally, and induced abortion in the first trimester had become safer than childbirth. In 1973, Roe vs. Wade acknowledged that abortion in the first trimester was safer than childbirth:* * *   * *   The Soviet Union (1919), Iceland (1935) and Sweden (1938) were among the first countries to legalize certain or all forms of abortion.    In 1935 Nazi Germany, a law was passed permitting abortions for those deemed "hereditarily ill," while women considered of German stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions. * * * *   Beginning in the second half of the twentieth century, abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries. ==   Religious ethics influence on both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion. right to live, making abortion morally the same as murder. The latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights, especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.==   reproductive health are major issues of human rights that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. fetal development, parents be consent of the fetus father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform patients of health risks of the procedureâ€”sometimes including those not supported by the medical literatureâ€”and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary.Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. However, many, but not all, of these will allow them to be performed in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, whether the fetus development is impaired, whether the mothers physical or mental well-being is endangered, or whether there are socioeconomic considerations that could be taken into consideration.  In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua, rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy have been noted.   Some countries, such as Bangledesh, that nominally ban abortion, may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene.  In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies.  Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves. Emergency contraception is generally available in countries that have not restricted abortion, and is also sometimes available in countries that have otherwise banned abortion, such as Abortion in Chile|Chile.   This has caused controversy, as some pro-life groups have advocated that certain forms of emergency contraception are not contraceptives but abortifacients.==  Sonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion, or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.  This deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex-selective abortion or even sex-screening.       In China, a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the one-child policy, which was enacted in 1979. ==  defense of others, committed in order to protect the lives of fetuses. David Gunn, John Britton, Barnett Slepian, and George Tillerâ€”have been assassinated. Attempted assassinations have also taken place in the United States and Canada, and other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards, have been killed in the United States and Australia. Hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have also occurred.     Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include Eric Robert Rudolph, Scott Roeder, Shelley Shannon, and Paul Jennings Hill, the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider. ==  at Angkor Wat, Cambodia, c. 1150, depicting a demon inducing an abortion by pounding the abdomen of a pregnant woman with a pestle.  ]] earliest known representations of abortion is in a bas relief at Angkor Wat (c.â€‰1150).
