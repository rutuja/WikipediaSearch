It is an outer locative case, used just as the adessive and allative cases to denote both being on top of something and "being around the place" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the elative, which means "from out of" or "from the inside of"). In the locative meaning, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.The Finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltÃ¤ according to the regular rules of vowel harmony.Usage* away from a place::Katolta:::Off the roof::PÃ¶ydÃ¤ltÃ¤:::Off the table::Rannalta:::From the beach::Maalta:::From the land::MereltÃ¤:::From the sea* to stop some activity with the verb lÃ¤hteÃ¤::lÃ¤hteÃ¤ tupakalta:::stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now; literally leave from the tobacco)::lÃ¤hteÃ¤ hippasilta:::stop playing the game of tag (hippa=tag, olla hippasilla=playing tag)* to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something::haisee pahalta:::smells bad::maistuu hyvÃ¤ltÃ¤:::tastes good::tuntuu kamalalta:::feels awful::nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ tyhmÃ¤ltÃ¤:::looks stupid::kuulostaa mukavalta:::sounds nice==The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe movement away from a solid object.  For example, if one is walking away from a friend one could say: a barÃ¡tomtÃ³l jÃ¶vÃ¶k - I am coming (away from) my friend.Note that this case in this example implies that the user was next to the solid object, and not inside it.  This means that if one saida postÃ¡tÃ³l jÃ¶vÃ¶k it would mean one is coming from being stood next to the post office, and that you were not inside the building. The application of vowel harmony gives two different suffixes:  -tÃ³l and -tÅ‘l.  These are applied to back- and front-vowel words respectively.Its partners for movement towards a solid object and for being next to that solid object are the allative case and the adessive case respectively.   Its partners that correspond to movement away from, or out of, something are the delative case (for movement from a surface or from a Hungarian city) and the elative case (for movement out of a container or from out of an international city).== Azeri ( ) is expressed through the suffixes -dan or -dÉ™n.
