Although there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as The Acropolis without qualification. The Acropolis was formally proclaimed as the preeminent monument on the European Cultural Heritage list of monuments on 26 March 2007.  The Acropolis is a flat-topped rock that rises   above sea level in the city of Athens, with a surface area of about 3 hectares.  It was also known as Cecropia, after the legendary snake|serpent-man, Cecrops I|Cecrops, the first Athenian king.== Mycenaean megaron Bronze Age.  Nothing of this megaron survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps. Soon after the palace was constructed, a Cyclopean massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century.  The wall consisted of two parapets built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called emplekton (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον).  ,Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library  The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that  it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  Homer is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the "strong-built House of Erechtheus" (Odyssey 7.81). At some point before the 13th century an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the acropolis. This fissure extended some thirty five meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug.  An elaborate set of stairs were built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period.==There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was such a palace, it seems to have been supplanted by later building activity on the Acropolis. Not much is known as to the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the archaic era. In the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was taken over by  s d etat. Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the Enneapylon, had been built around the biggest water spring, the "Clepsydra", at the northwestern foot.== Doric limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the "Bluebeard" temple, named after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue. Whether this temple replaced an older one, or a mere sacred precinct or altar, is not known. In the late 6th century BC yet another temple was built, usually referred to as the Archaios Naos (Old Temple). This temple of Athena Polias was built upon the Doerpfeld foundations.  It is unknown where the "Bluebeard" temple was built. There are two popular theories (1) the "Bluebeard" temple was built upon the Doerpfeld foundations, (2) the "Bluebeard" temple was built where the Parthenon now stands.  That being said it is unknown if the "Bluebeard" temple and the Archaios Naos coexisted. German for Marathon in 490 BC. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared of older remnants, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of Piraeus limestone, a foundation   deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall.The Older Parthenon was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC. The building was burned and looted, along with the Archaios Naos and practically everything else on the rock. After the Persian crisis had subsided, the Athenians incorporated many of the unfinished temples architectural members (unfluted column drums, triglyphs, metopes, etc.) into the newly built northern curtain wall of the Acropolis, where they serve as a prominent "war memorial" and can still be seen today. The devastated site was cleared of debris. Statuary, cult objects, religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill, serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic Parthenon. This Perserschutt|"Persian debris" is the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the Acropolis. ]] ]]== Golden Age Eurymedon in 468 BC, Cimon and Themistocles ordered the reconstruction of southern and northern walls, and Pericles entrusted the building of the Parthenon to Ictinus and Callicrates.In 437 BC, Mnesicles started building the Propylaea, monumental gates with columns of Pentelic marble, partly built upon the old propylaea of Pisistratus. These colonnades were almost finished in 432 BC and had two wings, the northern one serving as picture gallery. At the same time, south of the propylaea, building of the small Ionic Temple of Athena Nike commenced. After an interruption caused by the Peloponnesian War, the temple was finished in the time of Nicias peace, between 421 BC and 415 BC.During the same period as the building of the Erechtheum, a combination of sacred precincts including the temples of Athena Polias, Poseidon, Erechtheus, Cecrops, Herse, Pandrosos and Aglauros, with its so-called the Kore Porch (or Caryatids balcony), was begun.Between the temple of Athena Nike and the Parthenon, there was the temenos of Artemis Brauronia or Brauroneion, the goddess represented as a bear and worshipped in the deme of Brauron. The archaic xoanon of the goddess and a statue made by Praxiteles in the 4th century BC were both in the sanctuary.Behind the Propylaea, Phidias gigantic bronze statue of Athena Promachos ("she who fights in the front line"), built between 450 BC and 448 BC, dominated. The base was   high, while the total height of the statue was  . The goddess held a lance whose gilt tip could be seen as a reflection by crews on ships rounding Cape Sounion, and a giant shield on the left side, decorated by Mys with images of the fight between the Centaurs and the Lapiths. Other monuments that have left almost nothing visible to the present day are the Chalkotheke, the Pandroseion, Pandions sanctuary, Athenas altar, Zeus Polieuss sanctuary and, from Roman times, the circular temple of Augustus and Roma (mythology)|Rome.== Attalid kings stoa on Attalos in Agora below.

In the following century, on the South slope, Herodes Atticus built his grand Odeon of Herodes Atticus|odeon.  siege of 1687]]During the 3rd century, under threat from a Herulian invasion, repairs were made to the Acropolis walls, and the "Beule Gate" was constructed to restrict entrance in front of the Propylaia, thus returning the Acropolis to use as a fortress. ==In the Byzantine period, the Parthenon was turned into a church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Under the Latin Duchy of Athens, the Acropolis functioned as the citys administrative center, with the Parthenon as its cathedral, and the Propylaia as part of the Ducal Palace. A large tower was added, the "Frankopyrgos" (Tower of the Franks), demolished in the 19th century.   Ottoman conquest of Greece, the Parthenon was used as the garrison headquarters of the Turkish army,  and the Erechtheum was turned into the Governors private Harem. The buildings of the Acropolis suffered significant damage during the 1687 siege by the Venetians in the Morean War.  The Parthenon, which was being used as a gunpowder Magazine (artillery)|magazine, was hit by artillery fire and severely damaged.   Hellenizing project that swept the new nation-state. The entrance to the Acropolis was a monumental gateway called the Propylaea. To the south of the entrance is the tiny Temple of Athena Nike. A bronze statue of Athena, sculpted by Phidias, originally stood at its centre. At the centre of the Acropolis is the Parthenon or Temple of Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin). East of the entrance and north of the Parthenon is the temple known as the Erechtheum. South of the platform that forms the top of the Acropolis there are also the remains of an outdoor theatre called Theatre of Dionysus. A few hundred metres away, there is the now partially reconstructed Theatre of Herodes Atticus.All the valuable ancient artifacts are situated in the Acropolis Museum, which resides on the southern slope of the same rock, 280 metres from the Parthenon.==Site plan of the Acropolis at Athens showing the major archaeological remains Image:AcropolisatathensSitePlan.png|right|600px|alt=Site plan of the Acropolis at Athenspoly 332 198 447 158 468 217 352 254 Parthenonpoly 305 130 374 115 385 146 314 167 Old Temple of Athenapoly 346 116 389 108 375 71 334 82 Erechtheum Statue of Athena Promachospoly 104 164 193 115 225 200 158 224 Propylaeapoly 132 223 152 226 150 257 136 255 Temple of Athena Nikepoly 168 256 193 261 188 278 166 277 Eleusinion Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia or Brauroneionpoly 248 260 315 276 321 245 255 231 Chalkothekepoly 322 78 337 97 343 111 310 122 304 108 Pandroseionpoly 258 81 281 73 288 96 266 102 Arrephorionpoly 402 102 428 100 435 120 408 127 Altar of Athenapoly 462 120 500 96 540 96 533 136 506 146 464 149 Sanctuary of Zeus Polieuspoly 574 155 641 184 628 212 564 183 Sanctuary of Pandionpoly 26 384 56 336 88 314 129 313 160 337 174 370 175 399 139 416 72 417 25 402 Odeon of Herodes Atticuspoly 182 381 462 384 460 419 179 415 Stoa of Eumenes Sanctuary of Asclepius or Asclepieion Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereuspoly 655 343 738 276 807 356 722 425 Odeon of Pericles Temenos of Dionysus Eleuthereuspoly 300 32 332 42 323 67 296 64 Aglaureion #Parthenon#Old Temple of Athena#Erechtheum#Statue of Athena Promachos#Propylaea#Temple of Athena Nike#Eleusinion#Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia or Brauroneion#Chalkotheke#Pandroseion#Arrephorion#Altar of Athena#Sanctuary of Zeus Polieus#Sanctuary of Pandion#Odeon of Herodes Atticus#Stoa of Eumenes#Sanctuary of Asclepius or Asclepieion Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus#Odeon of Pericles Temenos of Dionysus Eleuthereus#AglaureionThe Project began in 1975 and is now nearing completion.  The aim of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction by acts of war, and misguided past restorations.  The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material - with new marble from Mount Penteli used sparingly.  All restoration was made using titanium dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things.  A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.The Parthenon colonnades, largely destroyed by Venetian bombardment in the 17th century, were restored, with many wrongly assembled columns now properly placed.  The roof and floor of the Propylaea were partly restored, with sections of the roof made of new marble and decorated with blue and gold inserts, as in the original.  The temple of Athena Nike is the only edifice still unfinished, pending proper reassembly of its parts, all of which survive practically intact.A total of 2,675 tons of architectural members were restored, with 686 stones reassembled from fragments of the originals, 905 patched with new marble, and 186 parts made entirely of new marble.  A total of 530 cubic meters of new Pentelic marble were used.Every four years, the Athenians held a festival called the Panathenaea that rivalled the Olympic Games in popularity. During the festival, a procession moved through Athens up to the Acropolis and into the Parthenon (Suggested to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze). There, a vast robe of woven wool (peplos) was ceremoniously placed on Phidias massive ivory and gold statue of Athena.;Notes ;Bibliography*Hurwit, J (2000).
