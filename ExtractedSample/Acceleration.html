(Negative acceleration i.e. retardation, also has the same dimensions/units.)Proper acceleration, the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer. magnitude of velocity); a decrease in speed is called deceleration. In physics, a change in the direction of velocity also is an acceleration: for  rotary motion, the change in direction of velocity results in centripetal (toward the center) acceleration; whereas the rate of change of speed is a tangential acceleration. force acting on it (Newtons laws of motion|Newtons second law):: \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} \quad \to \quad \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}/m  mass of the body, and a is its acceleration.  Average acceleration is the change in velocity (Δv) divided by the change in time (Δt). Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration at a specific point in time which is for a very short interval of time as Δt approaches zero.    function of time can be written as:: \mathbf{v} (t) =v(t) \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} = v(t) \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(t) ,  with v(t) equal to the speed of travel along the path, and: \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} = \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} \ ,   unit vector tangent to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time. Taking into account both the changing speed v(t) and the changing direction of u t , the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved path on a planar surface can be written using the chain rule of differentiation  and the derivative of the product of two functions of time  as:: \begin{alignat}{3}\mathbf{a} &amp; = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \\           &amp; =  \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} +v(t)\frac{d \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}}{dt} \\           &amp; = \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}+ \frac{v^2}{R}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}\ , \\\end{alignat}  osculating circle at time t. These components are called the tangential acceleration and the radial acceleration or centripetal acceleration (see also circular motion and centripetal force). title = author = page = url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MwrDfvrQyWYC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=particle+%22planar+motion%22#PPA164,M1 isbn = publisher = year = 2003  }}    ==Uniform or constant acceleration is a type of motion in which the velocity of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period. A frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the gravitational field strength standard gravity|g (also called acceleration due to gravity). By Newtons Second Law the force, F, acting on a body is given by::  \mathbf {F} = m  \mathbf {g} Due to the simple algebraic properties of constant acceleration in the one-dimensional case (that is, the case of acceleration aligned with the initial velocity), there are simple formulas that relate the following quantities: displacement (vector)|displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time:  :  \mathbf {v}= \mathbf {u} + \mathbf {a} t  :  \mathbf {s}= \mathbf {u} t+   \mathbf {a}t^2 =    :  |\mathbf {v}|^2= |\mathbf {u}|^2 + 2 \, \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {s}  where : \mathbf{s}  = displacement: \mathbf{u}  = initial velocity: \mathbf{v}  = final velocity: \mathbf{a}  = uniform acceleration: t  = time.In the case of uniform acceleration of an object that is initially moving in a direction not aligned with the acceleration, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations.  As Galileo showed, the net result is parabolic motion, as in the trajectory of a cannonball, neglecting air resistance.  ==An example of a body experiencing acceleration of a uniform magnitude but changing direction is uniform circular motion. In this case, because the direction of the objects motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the objects velocity also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the value::  a =   where v is the objects speed. Equivalently, the radial acceleration may be calculated from the objects angular velocity  \omega , whence::  \mathbf {a}= {-\omega^2}  \mathbf {r}.   centripetal – the so called centrifugal force appearing to act outward on a body is really a pseudo force experienced in the frame of reference of the body in circular motion, due to the bodys linear momentum at a tangent to the circle. "The force one feels from gravity and the force one feels from acceleration are the same.  They are equivalent.  Einstein called this the principle of equivalence.  Since gravity and acceleration are equivalent, if you feel gravitys influence, you must be accelerating.  Einstein argued that only those observers who feel no force at all - including the force of gravity - are justified in declaring that they are not accelerating."
