The Milky Way, for example, has an absolute magnitude of about −20.5. So a quasar at an absolute magnitude of −25.5 is 100 times brighter than our galaxy (because (10 0.4 ) (-20.5-(-25.5))  = (10 0.4 ) 5  = 100). If this particular quasar and our galaxy could be seen side by side at the same distance, the quasar would be 5 magnitudes (or 100 times) brighter than our galaxy.In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light years, or 3 × 10 14  kilometres).A star at 10 parsecs has a parallax of 0.1" (100 milli arc seconds).For galaxies (which are of course themselves much larger than 10 parsecs, and whose overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances) the absolute magnitude is defined by reference to the apparent brightness of a point-like or star-like source of the same total luminosity as the galaxy, as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance. bolometric magnitude. The bolometric magnitude can be computed from the visual magnitude plus a bolometric correction,  M_{bol}=M_V+BC . This correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation, while very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation (see Plancks law). The dimmer an object (at a distance of 10 parsecs) would appear, the higher its absolute magnitude. The lower an objects absolute magnitude, the higher its luminosity. A mathematical equation relates apparent magnitude to absolute magnitude, via parallax. Naos (−6.0), and Betelgeuse (−5.6). For comparison, Sirius has an absolute magnitude of 1.4 which is greater than the Suns absolute visual magnitude of 4.83 (it actually serves as a reference point). The Suns absolute bolometric magnitude is 4.75.  M87 has an absolute magnitude of −22 (i.e. as bright as about 60,000 stars of magnitude -10).==One can compute the absolute magnitude  M\!\,  of an object given its apparent magnitude  m\!\,  and luminosity distance  D_L\!\, ::  M = m - 5 ((\log_{10}{D_L}) - 1)\!\,  where  D_L\!\,  is the stars luminosity distance in parsecs, wherein 1 parsec is approximately 3.2616 light-years. For very large distances, cosmological redshift complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude, and an additional k correction might be required.For nearby astronomical objects (such as stars in our galaxy) luminosity distance D L  is almost identical to the real distance to the object, because spacetime within our galaxy is almost Euclidean. For much more distant objects the Euclidean approximation is not valid, and General Relativity must be taken into account when calculating the luminosity distance of an object.In the Euclidean approximation for nearby objects, the absolute magnitude  M\!\,  of a star can be calculated from its apparent magnitude and parallax::  M = m + 5 (1 + \log_{10}{p})\!\, where p is the stars parallax in arcseconds.You can also compute the absolute magnitude  M\!\,  of an object given its apparent magnitude  m\!\,  and distance modulus  \mu\!\, ::  M = m - {\mu}.\!\,  Examples Rigel has a visual magnitude of   m_V = 0.18   and distance about 773 light-years: M_V = 0.18 - 5 \cdot (\log_{10} \frac{773}{3.2616} - 1) = -6.7. Vega has a parallax of 0.129", and an apparent magnitude of +0.03: M_V = 0.03 + 5 \cdot (1 +\log_{10}{0.129}) = +0.6. Alpha Centauri A has a parallax of 0.742" and an apparent magnitude of −0.01: M_V = -0.01 + 5 \cdot (1 +\log_{10}{0.742}) = +4.3. The Black Eye Galaxy has a visual magnitude of m V =+9.36 and a distance modulus of 31.06.: M_V = 9.36 - 31.06 = -21.7. == Given the absolute magnitude  M\!\, , for objects within our galaxy you can also calculate the apparent magnitude  m\!\,  from any distance  d\!\,  (in parsecs)::  m = M - 5 (1-\log_{10}{d}).\!\, For objects at very great distances (outside our galaxy) the luminosity distance D L  must be used instead of d (in parsecs).Given the absolute magnitude  M\!\, , you can also compute apparent magnitude  m\!\,  from its parallax  p\!\, ::  m = M - 5 ( 1+ \log_{10}p).\!\, Also calculating absolute magnitude  M\!\,  from distance modulus  \mu\!\, ::  m = M + {\mu}.\!\, == Bolometric magnitude electromagnetic wavelengths, including those unobserved due to instrumental pass-band, the Earths atmospheric absorption, or extinction by interstellar dust. For stars, in the absence of extensive observations at many wavelengths, it usually must be computed assuming an effective temperature. For planets, comets and asteroids a different definition of absolute magnitude is used which is more meaningful for nonstellar objects. phase angle phase curve.To convert a stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one, subtract 31.57.==The absolute magnitude can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions.: m = H + 2.5 \log_{10}{\left(\frac{d_{BS}^2 d_{BO}^2}{p(\chi) d_0^4}\right)}\!\,  phase angle, the angle between the Sun–Body and Body–Observer lines. By the law of cosines, we have:: \cos{\chi} = \frac{ d_{BO}^2 + d_{BS}^2 - d_{OS}^2 } {2 d_{BO} d_{BS}}.\!\,  p(\chi)\!\,  is the phase integral (integration of reflected light; a number in the 0 to 1 range). Ideal diffuse reflecting sphere. A reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies: p(\chi) = \frac{2}{3} \left( \left(1 - \frac{\chi}{\pi}\right) \cos{\chi} + \frac{1}{\pi} \sin{\chi} \right).\!\, A full-phase diffuse sphere reflects ⅔ as much light as a diffuse disc of the same diameter.
