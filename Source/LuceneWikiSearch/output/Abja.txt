AbjadAn abjad is a type of writing system where each symbol always or usually  stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel. West Semitic. In popular usage, abjads often contain the word "alphabet" in their names, such as "Arabic alphabet" and "Phoenician alphabet". The name "abjad" is derived from the Arabic word for alphabet. The word "alphabet" in English has a source in Greek language in which the first two letters were "A" (alpha) and "B" (beta), hence "alphabeta". In Arabic, "A" ( ), "B" ( ), " " ( ), "D" ( ) make the word "abjad" which means "alphabet". It is also used to enumerate a list in the same manner that "a, b, c, d" (etc.) are used in the English language.  Phoenician and Semitic alphabets; from right to left:  ) or  . vowel marks nikkud for Hebrew and harakat|harakÄ�t for Arabic, their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas always mark the vowels (other than the "inherent" vowel) with a diacritic, a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone glyph. Some abugidas use a special symbol to suppress the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a syllabary, a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.   Semitic family of scripts. These scripts are thought to derive from the Middle Bronze Age alphabets#Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic alphabet (dated to about 1500 BC), which is thought to derive from Egyptian hieroglyphs . The abjad was significantly simpler than the earlier hieroglyphs. The number of distinct glyphs was reduced tremendously at the cost of increased ambiguity. Phoenician abjad. Cuneiform and Latin and Cyrillic, while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia. Hebrew and Nabataean abjads, Syriac script was a cursive variation of Aramaic. It is unclear whether the Arabic abjad was derived from Nabatean or Syriac.  Aramaic and Avestan alphabet|Avestan, are "impure" abjads, that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes. An example of a "pure" abjad is ancient Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician.==  guttural sounds heth or waw and yod were also used. The Greek alphabet thus became the worlds first "true" alphabet. Aramaic abjad, it has been hypothesised). morphological structure a root consisting of (usually) three consonants, the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms.  For instance, according to Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic, the Arabic root     (to sacrifice) can be derived the forms     (he sacrificed),     (you (masculine singular) sacrificed),     (he slaughtered),     (he slaughters), and     (slaughterhouse). In each case, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, improving word recognition   while reading. {|class="wikitable sortable"|- ID! scope="col" width="20" | Name! scope="col" width="20" | In Use! scope="col" width="20" | Do the letters connect! scope="col" width="20" | Direction! scope="col" width="20" | # of letters! scope="col" width="20" | Country of Origin! scope="col" width="20" | Used By Languages! scope="col" width="20" | Time Period (age) Influenced By Writing Systems Influenced|- 1| Syriac || yes || yes || right-left || 22 consonants || Middle-East || Syrian Church||Aramaic, Syriac, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic || ~ 700 BCE  , http://www.omniglot.com/writing/alphabetic.htm. || || Nabatean, Palmyran, Mandaic, Parthian, Pahlavi, Sogdian, Avestan and Manichean |- 2| Hebrew ||  yes || no || right-left || 22 consonants + final letters || Ancient Israel || Israelis, Jewish People ||Hebrew, Ladino, Bukhari, Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic || > 1100 BCE|| Proto-Hebrew, Early Aramaic || |- 3| Arabic || yes || yes || right-left, numerals are written left-right || 28 (9 numbers)|| Middle-East || Over 200million people || Arabic, Bosnian, Kashmiri, Kurdish, Kyrghyz, Malay, Persian/Farsi, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Turkish, Urdu, Uyghur, others  || ~ 500 ACE  || Nabataean Aramaic|| |- 4| Aramaic (Imperial) || no || no || right-left || 22 || Middle-East || Archaemenid, Persian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires || Imperial Aramaic, Hebrew || ~ 500 BCE  || Phoenician || Late Hebrew, Nabataean, Syriac|- 5| Aramaic (Early) || no || no || right-left || 22 || Middle-East || Jews || Languages || ~ 1000-900 BCE|| Phoenician || Hebrew, Imperial Aramaic. |- 6| Ancient Berber || no || no || top-bottom, right-left  || 22 (right-left) 25 (up-down)  , http://www.ancientscripts.com/berber.html.  || North Africa  || Women in Tuareg Society  || Tifinagh  || 600 BCE || Punic , South Arabian  || Tifinagh |- 7| Nabataean || Nabataean || 200 BCE || Aramaic || Arabic|- 8| Middle Persian, (Pahlavi) || no || no || right-left || 22 || Middle-East || Sassanian Empire || Pahlavi, Middle Persian ||   || Aramaic || Psalter, Avestan |- 9| Mandaic || no || yes || right-left || 24 || Iraq, Iran || AhvÄ�z, Iran || Mandaic || ~ 200 ACE|| Aramaic|| Neo-Mandaic|- 10| Psalter || no || yes || right-left || 21 || Northwestern China   || Persian Script for Paper Writing  || || ~ 400 ACE   , Encyclopedia Iranica. || Syriac   || |- 11| Phoenician || no || no || right-left, Boustrophedon || 22 || Byblos  || Canaanites || Phoenician, Punic || ~ 1000-1500 BCE || Proto- Canaanite Alphabet  || Punic(variant), Greek, Etruscan, Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew|- 12| Parthian || no || no || right-left || 22 || Parthia (modern day equivilant of Northeastern Iran)  || Parthian & Sassanian periods of Persian Empire  || Parthian || ~200 BCE || Aramaic || |- 13| Sabaean || no || no system || right-left, boustrophedon || 29 || Southern Arabia (Sheba) || Southern Arabians || Sabaean|| ~ 500 BCE || Byblos  || Ethiopic |- 14| Punic || no || no || right-left || 22 || Carthage (Tunisia), North Africa, Mediterranean  || Punic Culture || Punic, Neo-Punic || || Phoenician   || |- 15| Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic, Proto-Canaanite || no || no || right-left || 30 || Egypt, Sinai, Canaan || Canaanites || Canaanite || ~ 1900-1700 BCE|| In conjunction with Egyptian Hieroglyphs   || Phoenician, Hebrew|- 16| Ugaritic || Ugarites || Ugaritic, Hurrian || ~ 1400 BCE  || || |- 17| South Arabian || no || no || right-left, left-right (reversed letters) || 29 || South-Arabia (Yemen) || Dmt Kingdom || Amharic, Tigrinya, Tigre, Semitic, Chushitic, Nilo-Saharan   || 900 BCE   || Proto-Sinaitic || Geez (Ethiopia)|- 18| Sogdian || no || no (yes in later versions)|| right-left, left-right(vertical) || 20 || parts of China (Xinjiang), Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan || Buddhists, Manichaens || Sogdian || ~ 400 ACE|| Syriac || Old Uyghur alphabet, Yaqnabi(Tajikistan dialect)  |- 19| Samaritan || yes (700 people) || no || right-left || 22 || Mesopatamia or Levant (Disputed) || Samaritans (Nablus and Holon) || Samaritan Aramaic, Samaritan Hebrew|| ~ 100-0 BCE|| Paleo-Hebrew Alphabet || |} Abjad numerals* Abugida* Gematria (Hebrew system of mystical numerology)* Numerology* Shorthand (constructed writing systems that are structurally abjads); Sources*
