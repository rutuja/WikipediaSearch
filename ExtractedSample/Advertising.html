Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers (town criers) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers.As education became an apparent need and reading, as well as printing, developed advertising expanded to include handbills. In the 17th century advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as disease ravaged Europe. However, false advertising and so-called "Quackery|quack" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.As the economy expanded during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising. La Presse profitability and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, Volney B. Palmer established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad - the copy, layout, and artwork - was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation  changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer &amp; Son was founded. Ayer and Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.    Around the same time, in France, Charles-Louis Havas extended the services of his news agency, Havas to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize. At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.   N. W. Ayer &amp; Son was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W.

However, radio station owners soon realised they could earn more money by selling sponsorship rights in small time allocations to multiple businesses throughout their radio stations broadcasts, rather than selling the sponsorship rights to single businesses per show.This practice was carried over to commercial television in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  Public Broadcasting Act which led to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR).In the early 1950s, the DuMont Television Network began the modern practice of selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as The United States Steel Hour. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show—up to and including having ones advertising agency actually writing the show. The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the Hallmark Hall of Fame. alliterative   theme Put a Tiger in Your Tank.

For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on Tram|streetcars, and outdoor posters. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower—about 2.4 percent.  text messages, and various innovations utilizing social network services such as Facebook.==The advertising techniques used to promote commercial goods and services can be used to inform, educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues, such as HIV/AIDS, political ideology, energy conservation and deforestation. David Ogilvy.Public service advertising, non-commercial advertising, public interest advertising, cause marketing, and social marketing are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers. World Wars II under the direction of more than one government. During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the Ad Council) which is the nations largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running PSA campaign, Smokey Bear. The marketing mix has been the key concept to advertising.  The marketing mix was suggested by professor E. Jerome McCarthy in the 1960s.  The marketing mix consists of four basic elements called the four P’s.Product is the first P representing the actual product. Price represents the process of determining the value of a product.  Place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer like distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization.

Blade Runner includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a Coca-Cola billboard.;Press advertising: Press advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. A form of press advertising is classified advertising, which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad for a low fee advertising a product or service.  Another form of press advertising is the Display Ad, which is a larger ad (can include art) that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.;Billboard advertising: Billboards are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large amounts of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums.  newspaper advertised to its target market at North Avenue Beach with a sailboat billboard on Lake Michigan.]];Mobile billboard advertising: Mobile billboards are generally vehicle mounted billboards or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being Backlight|backlit, and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: Target advertising, One-day, and long-term campaigns, Conventions, Sporting events, Store openings and similar promotional events, and Big advertisements from smaller companies.;In-store advertising: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store.

Working with products such as Reverse Graffiti, air dancers  and 3D pavement advertising, the media became an affordable and effective tool for getting brand messages out into public spaces.;Celebrity branding: This type of advertising focuses upon using celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products and promote specific stores or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however. One mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the public relations of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer Michael Phelps contract with Kelloggs was terminated, as Kelloggs did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana. text ads, Rich Media Ads, Social network advertising, online classified advertising, advertising networks and e-mail marketing, including e-mail spam.Sales promotions are another way to advertise,  Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers you draw in and where they are, and to jumpstart sales.  Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts.  The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action. Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward consumers usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like digital video recorders (DVRs) such as TiVo.Digital signage is poised to become a major mass media because of its ability to reach larger audiences for less money.  Digital signage also offer the unique ability to see the target audience where they are reached by the medium.  Technological advances have also made it possible to control the message on digital signage with much precision, enabling the messages to be relevant to the target audience at any given time and location which in turn, gets more response from the advertising.  Digital signage is being successfully employed in supermarkets.   Another successful use of digital signage is in hospitality locations such as restaurants.  and malls. Advertising on the World Wide Web is a recent phenomenon. Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the "relevance" of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.Reasons for online display advertising: Display ads generate awareness quickly. Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for generating awareness, it’s used for direct response campaigns that link to a landing page with a clear ‘call to action’.E-mail advertising is another recent phenomenon. Unsolicited bulk E-mail advertising is known as "e-mail spam".  Spam has been a problem for e-mail users for many years.A new form of advertising that is growing rapidly is social network advertising. It is online advertising with a focus on social networking sites. This is a relatively immature market, but it has shown a lot of promise as advertisers are able to take advantage of the demographic information the user has provided to the social networking site. Friendertising is a more precise advertising term in which people are able to direct advertisements toward others directly using social network service.As the mobile phone became a new mass media in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland, it was only a matter of time until mobile advertising followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000. By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2.2 billion and providers such as Admob delivered billions of mobile ads. 2D Barcode, which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.Some companies have proposed placing messages or corporate logos on the side of booster rockets and the International Space Station. Unpaid advertising (also called "publicity advertising"), can provide good exposure at minimal cost. Personal recommendations ("bring a friend", "sell it"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, "Xerox" = "photocopier", "Kleenex" = Facial tissue|tissue, "Vaseline" = petroleum jelly, "The Hoover Company|Hoover" = vacuum cleaner, and "Band-Aid" = adhesive bandage) — these can be seen as the pinnacle of any advertising campaign. However, some companies oppose the use of their brand name to label an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand into a genericized trademark - turning it into a generic term which means that its legal protection as a trademark is lost.From time to time, The CW Television Network airs short programming breaks called "Content Wraps," to advertise one companys product during an entire commercial break. The CW pioneered "content wraps" and some products featured were Herbal Essences, Crest (toothpaste)|Crest, Guitar Hero II, CoverGirl, and recently Toyota.Recently, there appeared a new promotion concept, "ARvertising", advertising on Augmented Reality technology. subliminal advertising (see mind control), and the pervasiveness of mass messages (see propaganda).==With the dawn of the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Popup, Adobe Flash|Flash, Web banner|banner, Popunder, advergaming, and email advertisements (the last often being a form of spam) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend. In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009 mobile and internet advertising grew by 18.1% and 9.2% respectively. Older media advertising saw declines: −10.1% (TV), −11.7% (radio), −14.8% (magazines) and −18.7% (newspapers ). ==Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the niche market using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of The Long Tail, advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest mass market audience possible. However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined, leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies marketing products. Among others, Comcast Spotlight is one such advertiser employing this method in their video on demand menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice at any time, right from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view. == The concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of user-generated advertisements. User-generated ads are created by consumers as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, most often they are a result of brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of PepsiCo held the Crash the Super Bowl contest, allowing consumers to create their own Doritos commercial.    Chevrolet held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.  Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsens BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about".  This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, Zooppa has launched ad competitions for brands such as Google, Nike, Inc.|Nike, Hershey’s, General Mills, Microsoft, NBC Universal, Zinio, and Mini Cooper. Crowdsourced advertisements have gained popularity in part to its cost effective nature, high consumer engagement, and ability to generate word-of-mouth. However, it remains controversial, as the long-term impact on the advertising industry is still unclear. ==Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic, export, international, multi-national, and global. For   in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company’s speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel. Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how economies of scale  are maximised. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market.  ,   and   provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad. ==Foreign governments, particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces.  A prime example of this messaging technique is  *See also: International Tourism Advertising== TAXI and SMART in Australia and has been referred to as "a revolution in the ad world".  ==The ability to record shows on digital video recorders (such as TiVo) allow users to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded box sets are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are sold, means the company will receive additional profits from the sales of these sets. To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed.  Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like Survivor (TV series)|Survivor. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected EPGs, advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating TV apps.  Additionally, some like brands have opted for social television sponsorship.==Advertising education has become widely popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis. A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking. A unique model for teaching advertising is the student-run advertising agency, where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.   Organizations such as American Advertising Federation and AdU Network partner established companies with students to create these campaigns.  Unsolicited commercial spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers.  Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.   In addition, advertising frequently uses psychological pressure (for example, appealing to feelings of inadequacy)  on the intended consumer, which may be harmful.Many even feel that often, advertisments exploit the desires of a consumer, by making a particular product more appealing, by playing with the consumers needs and wants. There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples are: the ban on television tobacco advertising imposed in many countries, and the total ban of advertising to children under 12 imposed by the Swedish government in 1991. Though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country, it has been weakened by the European Court of Justice, which had found that Sweden was obliged to accept foreign programming, including those from neighboring countries or via satellite. Greece’s regulations are of a similar nature, “banning advertisements for childrens toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys". In Europe and elsewhere, there is a vigorous debate on whether (or how much) advertising to children should be regulated. This debate was exacerbated by a report released by the Kaiser Family Foundation in February 2004 which suggested fast food advertising that targets children was an important factor in the epidemic of childhood obesity in the United States. Advertising Standards Authority in the UK.In the UK most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £2,500 per offence. All of the major outdoor billboard companies in the UK have convictions of this nature.In the US many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm.  As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside.  Cities such as São Paulo have introduced an outright ban  with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays.Many advertisers employ a wide-variety of linguistic devices to bypass regulatory laws (e.g. In France, printing English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with the Article 120 of the 1994 Toubon Law limiting the use of English).  The advertisement of controversial products such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many countries. For instance, the tobacco industry is required by law in most countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of their products. Linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative device to reduce the impact of such requirements. Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising.  It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies.  Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as copy testing) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns—pre-testing is done before an ad airs to gauge how well it will perform and post-testing is done after an ad airs to determine the in-market impact of the ad or campaign on the consumer.  Continuous ad tracking and the Communicus System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types. Today’s culture is made up of meanings between consumers and marketers.  These meanings depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects. Semiotics is the study of signs and how they are interpreted.  Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within brand names, logos, package designs, print advertisements, and television advertisements.  The purpose of semiotics is to study and interpret the message being conveyed in advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels known as the surface level and the underlying level.  The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for their product.  These signs can be images, words, fonts, colors, or slogan.  The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings.  The combination of images, words, colors, and slogan must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.  The “key to advertising analysis” is the signifier and the signified.  The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept.    A product has a signifier and a signified.  The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology.  The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative.  The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product.  A television’s denotative meaning would be that it is high definition.  The connotative meaning is the product’s deep and hidden meaning.  A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top of the line.  Apple is an excellent example of using semiotics in their advertising campaign.   Apple’s commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of Apples target market.  They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing.  However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones.  Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod.  The white color signifies almost all of Apple’s products.    gender roles in advertising, individuals are influenced by three categories.  Certain characteristics of stumuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as feminine or masculine).  Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect attention and elaboration of the message (traditional or non-traditional gender role orientation).  Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.  service feature.  For instance, the camera has auto focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective, impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service.  They are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived, as they have no physical reality.  For instance the brochure has a beautiful design.   Males tend to respond better to objective marketing communications claims while females tend to respond better to subjective marketing communications claims. When advertising to different genders it is important to remember how men and women process information.  Females process information comprehensively.  Males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures, methods or strategies for solving problems.   Men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation.In advertisements, men are represented as independent.  They are shown in more occupations than women.  Women are represented mainly as housewives and mothers.  Men are more likely to be shown advertising cars or business products, while women advertise domestic products.  Men are more likely to be shown outdoors or in business settings.  Women are depicted in domestic settings. Men are more often portrayed as authorities.  As far as ads go, with age men seem to gain wisdom and authority.  On the other hand women seem to disappear with age.  Voiceovers are commonly used in advertising.  Most voiceovers are men (figures of up to 94% have been reported).  There have been more female voiceovers in recent years but mainly for food, household products, and feminine care products.    * Ad server* Advertising Adstock* Advertising to children* American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame* Branded content* Classified advertising* Communication design* Conquesting* Coolhunting* Copy testing* Copywriting* Crowd manipulation* European Destinations of Excellence (EDEN)* Family in advertising* Gender advertisement* Guerrilla marketing* Graphic design * Informative advertising* Integrated Marketing Communications* Local advertising* Market overhang* Meta-advertising* Mobile Marketing* Performance-based advertising* Pseudo-event* Psychological manipulation* Public relations* Reality marketing* Scad (scam ad) * Senior media creative* SEO Copywriting* Sex in advertising* Shock advertising* Tobacco advertising* Video commerce* Video news release* Viral marketing* Virtual advertising* Visual communication* Web analytics* World Federation of Advertisers  ;General* Bhatia, Tej K. 2000.
