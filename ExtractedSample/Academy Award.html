The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world, and is televised live in more than 100 countries annually, however the first broadcast was not televised. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media; its equivalents, the Grammy Awards (for music), Emmy Awards (for television), and Tony Awards (for theatre) are modeled after the Academy.The AMPAS was originally conceived by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio boss Louis B. Mayer as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry’s image and help mediate labor disputes. The Oscar itself was later initiated by the Academy as an award "of merit for distinctive achievement" in the industry.  first Academy Hotel Roosevelt most recent films in films in 2011, will be held at Hollywoods Kodak Theatre on February 26, 2012.   and Joan Fontaine holding their Oscars at the Academy Awards, 1942]]The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private brunch at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people. The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.    The cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was $5. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927–1928 period.Winners had been announced three months earlier of their triumphs; however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.  This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners since 1941. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928 and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, Emil Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period. Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and the professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film.   , a total of 2,789 Oscars have been given for 1,825 awards.  A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards. Beau Geste is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Susan Hayward, Broderick Crawford) prior to any of the actors receiving the Best Actor Award.At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced. Until then, foreign language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.== britannium on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusade|crusaders sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians. MGMs art director Cedric Gibbons, one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll.  Emilio "El George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain  at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Gibbonss design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent tin and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes. Since 1983,  approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens &amp; Company.  In support of the American effort in World War II, the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended. == The root of the name Oscar is contested.  One biography of  !".  At the end of the day she asked, "What should we do with Oscar, put him in the vault?" and the name stuck.==Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.   In December 2011, Orson Welles 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane has been placed up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.  While the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.  Michael Todds grandson trying to sell Todds Oscar statuette illustrates that there are some who do not agree with this idea. When Todds grandson attempted to sell Todds Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector, the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury. Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to 2004, nomination results were announced publicly in early February.==The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,835  . Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academys composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies. All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then. ==Currently, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in Los Angeles County, California, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).  The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.  == , Hollywood, 1959]] , Hollywood, 2009]]The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast). tape delay in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources. ABC Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.   lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Championship, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period. (Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics.) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.  After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Pacific.   The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.  For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.  the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.In 1993, an In Memoriam segment was introduced,    honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.  This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45&amp;nbsp;seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion. The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season. But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony may have to compete with National Football League playoff games.  The Golden Globes are the third award broadcast behind only the Grammys and the Oscars. The results are sometimes called comparable to the results of the Academy Awards. However, rarely, in reviews of the Golden Globes, they are praised because of the wider range of awards due to their basis on genre and no limitations in regards to film. They also award globes for television. The Academy Awards do not base their awards on genre. However, the Golden Globes only award 15 globes in film, and the Oscars award twenty four.The following is a listing of all Academy Awards ceremonies and ratings since 1929.    {| class="sortable wikitable" style="text-align: center"|- Ceremony!

This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality.  William Friedkin, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself."

The third winner, Marlon Brando, refused his award (Best Actor in 1972 for The Godfather), citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.  At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony, Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms. It has been observed that several of the Academy Award winners – particularly Best Picture – have not stood the test of time nor defeated worthier efforts. Tim Dirks, editor of American Movie Classics|AMCs filmsite.org, has written of the Academy Awards, Best Picture is not the only category to come under criticism.  In his review of The Lives of Others, Nick Davis argued, Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons,  personal popularity,  atonement for past mistakes,  or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work.
