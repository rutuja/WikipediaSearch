Cantor equated the Absolute Infinite with God. §3.2,    He held that the Absolute Infinite had various mathematical properties, including that every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object .Cantor is quoted as saying: Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to Richard Dedekind (text in square brackets not present in original):   Cesare Burali-Fortis "paradox" that there can be no greatest ordinal number. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantors argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties. set formation, hierarchy and thus failing to contain every set. Axiom of Separation). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory. class to New Foundations by Willard Van Orman Quine.    * Actual infinity* Class (set theory)* Infinity* Limitation of size* Monadology* Reflection principle* The Ultimate (philosophy)    * Infinity and the Mind, Rudy Rucker, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1995, ISBN 0691001723; orig. pub.
