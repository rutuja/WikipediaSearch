Through its origins, acupuncture has been embedded in the concepts of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Its general theory is based on the premise that bodily functions are regulated by the flow of an energy-like entity called qi. Acupuncture aims to correct imbalances in the flow of qi by stimulation of anatomical locations on or under the skin called acupuncture points, most of which are connected by channels known as meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians.  Scientific research has not found any physical or biological correlate of qi, meridians and acupuncture points,            and some contemporary practitioners needle the body without using a theoretical framework, instead selecting points based on their tenderness to pressure.    The earliest written record of acupuncture is found in the Huangdi Neijing (黄帝内经; translated as The Yellow Emperors Inner Canon), dated approximately 200 BCE.   The practice of acupuncture expanded out of China into the areas now part of Japan, Korea and Taiwan, diverging from the narrower theory and practice of mainland TCM in the process.     A large number of contemporary practitioners outside of China follow these non-TCM practices, particularly in Europe.     effective for Cochrane review concluded stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point was as effective as antiemetic medications.   Acupuncture also appears to have a small effect in the short-term management of some types of pain      though a 2011 review of review articles  concluded that acupuncture was of doubtful efficacy in treating pain other than neck pain.   It has been suggested that the positive results reported for acupuncture can be explained by placebo effects and publication bias      and researchers have pointed out the difficulty in designing an adequate scientific control for any placebo effect acupuncture might have due to its invasiveness.        The development and inclusion of retracting needles as a form of placebo control has resulted in a much larger number of studies concluding acupunctures effects are due to placebo.   There is general agreement that acupuncture is safe when administered by well-trained practitioners using sterile needles           but does carry small but serious risks and adverse effects including death.     Accompanied by calls for more research, the use of acupuncture for certain conditions has been tentatively endorsed by the United States National Institutes of Health  and National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine,  the National Health Service of the United Kingdom,  and the World Health Organization,  though most of these endorsements have been criticized    and it has been questioned whether research on acupuncture is a good use of limited research funding.        (c. 1368–1644)|200px]]==In  ) but does not mention the meridians and may be a reference to    and may refer to the use of needles to drain water from joints or lance abscesses (though the Huangdi Neijing has been revised several times since its original publication in, and the oldest version currently available dates to the 11 century of the Common Era).    pictographs have been found dating from the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE|1600–1100 BCE) which suggest that acupuncture was practiced along with moxibustion.   It has also been suggested that acupuncture has its origins in bloodletting  or demonology. Despite improvements in metallurgy over centuries, it was not until the 2nd century BCE during the Han Dynasty that stone and bone needles were replaced with metal.  The earliest records of acupuncture is in the Shiji (史記, in English, Records of the Grand Historian) with references in later medical texts that are equivocal, but could be interpreted as discussing acupuncture. The earliest Chinese medical text to describe acupuncture is the Huangdi Neijing, the legendary Yellow Emperors Classic of Internal Medicine (History of Acupuncture) which was compiled around 305–204 BCE.   The Huangdi Neijing does not distinguish between acupuncture and moxibustion and gives the same indication for both treatments. The Mawangdui texts, which also date from the 2nd century BCE (though antedating both the Shiji and Huangdi Neijing), mention the use of pointed stones to open abscesses, and moxibustion but not acupuncture. However, by the 2nd century BCE, acupuncture replaced moxibustion as the primary treatment of systemic conditions. In Europe, examinations of the 5,000-year-old mummified body of Ötzi the Iceman have identified 15 groups of tattoos on his body, some of which are located on what are now seen as contemporary acupuncture points. This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in Eurasia during the early Bronze Age. ==   ).]]Korea is believed to be the first country acupuncture spread to outside of China.  Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by the legendary emperor Dangun though it is more likely brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture. Around ninety works on acupuncture were written in China between the Han Dynasty and the Song Dynasty, and the Emperor Renzong of Song, in 1023, ordered the production of a bronze statuette depicting the meridians and acupuncture points then in use. However, after the end of the Song Dynasty, acupuncture lost status, and started to be seen as a technical profession, in comparison to the more scholarly profession of herbalism. It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious practices like alchemy, shamanism, midwifery and moxibustion.  Portuguese missionaries in the 16th century were among the first to bring reports of acupuncture to the West.  Jacob de Bondt, a Dutch surgeon traveling in Asia, described the practice in both Japan and Java. However, in China itself the practice was increasingly associated with the lower-classes and illiterate practitioners. In 1674, Hermann Buschoff, a Dutch priest in Batavia, published the first book on moxibustion (from Japanese mogusa) for the cure of arthritis. The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by  Willem ten Rhijne, a Dutch physician who had worked at the Dutch trading post Dejima in Nagasaki for two years.  In 1757 the physician Xu Daqun described the further decline of acupuncture, saying it was a lost art, with few experts to instruct; its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes. In 1822, an edict from the Chinese Emperor banned the practice and teaching of acupuncture within the Imperial Academy of Medicine outright, as unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars. At this point, acupuncture was still cited in Europe with both skepticism and praise, with little study and only a small amount of experimentation. == Chinese Communist materialist assumptions Western practice of empirical investigation of nature.  Later the 1950s TCMs theory was again rewritten at Maos insistence as a political response to the lack of unity between scientific and traditional Chinese medicine, and to correct the supposed "bourgeois thought of Western doctors of medicine" (p. 109).  intravenous drip that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.   The greatest exposure in the West came when New York Times reporter James Reston, who accompanied Nixon during the visit, received acupuncture in China for post-operative pain after undergoing an emergency appendectomy under standard anesthesia. Reston experienced pain relief from the acupuncture and wrote it in The New York Times.  In 1973 the American Internal Revenue Service allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.   In 2006, a BBC documentary Alternative Medicine filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture-induced anesthesia. It was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of weak anesthetics that in combination could have a much more powerful effect. The program was also criticized for its fanciful interpretation of the results of a brain scanning experiment.       The use of acupuncture as anesthesia for surgery has fallen out of favor with scientifically trained surgeons in China. A delegation of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry reported in 1995: We were not shown acupuncture anesthesia for surgery, this apparently having fallen out of favor with scientifically trained surgeons. Dr. Han, for instance, had been emphatic that he and his colleagues see acupuncture only as an analgesic (pain reducer), not an anesthetic (an agent that blocks all conscious sensations). The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that bodily functions are regulated by an energy called qi which flows through the body; disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease.  Acupuncture describes a family of procedures aiming to correct imbalances in the flow of qi by stimulation of anatomical locations on or under the skin (usually called acupuncture points or acupoints), by a variety of techniques.  The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation. ==   Aung &amp; Chen, 2007, pp  .   In a general sense, qi is something that is defined by five "cardinal functions":  # Actuation (推動, tuīdòng) - of all physical processes in the body, especially the circulation of all body fluids such as blood in their vessels. This includes actuation of the functions of the Traditional Chinese medicine#Zàng-fǔ (organs)|zang-fu organs and meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians.# Warming (溫煦,  ) - the body, especially the limbs. Exogenous Pathogenic Factors# Containment (固攝,  ) - of body fluids, i.e. keeping blood, sweat, urine, semen etc. from leakage or excessive emission. xue (blood), jinye (“fluids”), and/or transformation of all of the latter into each other.To fulfill its functions, qi has to steadily flow from the inside of the body (where the  , of which those considered hollow organs (such as the stomach and intestines) were also considered yang while those considered solid (such as the liver and lungs) were considered yin.  They were also symbolically linked to the rivers found in ancient China, such as the Yangtze River|Yangtze, Wei River|Wei and Yellow Rivers.  Han times, the number of bones thought to be in the body).  The Huangdi Neijing mentioned only 160 and a further 135 could be deduced giving a total of 295.  The modern total was once considered 670 but subsequently expanded due to more recent interest in auricular (ear) acupuncture and the treatment of further conditions.  In addition, it is considered likely that some points used historically have since ceased being used. &lt;!---==TCM asserts that blood is propelled by qi, that the 100 blood “vessels are the pathways of the blood’, that the vessels gather at a specific acupuncture point (Taiyuan LU-9) associated with the lung (or lungs), and that when qi flow is not in balance, blood pools and stagnates.      Modern science-based medicine has shown that blood is propelled by pumping action of the heart, and that there are many more than 100 blood vessels, that the vessels do not gather at that or any specific point, and that blood doesnt fail to circulate except by failure of pumping by the heart, and does not pool or stagnate except when a vessel is physically blocked or the heart pumping is disrupted.---&gt;== In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin, yang, Traditional Chinese medicine#TCM model of the body|qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment. Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77  Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.   In the case of the meridians, typical disease patterns are invasions with Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|wind, cold and damp Excesses.  pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.      TCM and its concept of disease do not strongly differentiate between cause and effect.  In theory, however, Traditional Chinese medicine#Considerations of disease causes|endogenous, exogenous and miscellaneous causes of disease are recognized.   ==The acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient in order to make a diagnosis according to the tradition which he or she utilizes. In TCM, there are four diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. *Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.*Auscultation and olfaction refer, respectively, to listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing) and attending to body odor.*Inquiring focuses on the "seven inquiries", which are: chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and menses and leukorrhea.*Palpation includes feeling the body for tender Acupuncture#Qi, meridians and acupuncture points|A-shi points, and palpation of the left and right radial pulses at two levels of pressure (superficial and deep) and three positions Cun, Guan, Chi (immediately proximal to the wrist crease, and one and two fingers breadth proximally, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring fingers).Tongue and pulseExamination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in traditional Chinese medicine. The surface of the tongue is believed to contain a map of the entire body, and is used to determine acupuncture points to manipulate. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the liver.   TCM diagnosis also involves measuring for three superficial and three deep pulses at different locations on the radial artery of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses that are thought to correspond to twelve internal organs.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with terms like "floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick", which are used to ascribe a specific imbalance in the body.  Learning TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.  In a modern acupuncture session, an initial consultation is followed by taking the pulse on both arms, and an inspection of the tongue. Classically, in clinical practice, acupuncture is highly individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on controlled scientific research.  In the United States, acupuncture typically lasts from 10 to 60 minutes, with diagnosis and treatment for a single session ranging from $25 to $80 in 2011.    Sometimes needles are left in the ear for up to 3 days. Clinical practice varies depending on the country.   A comparison of the average number of patients treated per hour found significant differences between China (10) and the United States (1.2).     Aucpuncture is used to treat various type of pain, neurological problems and stroke rehabilitation.         Studies conducted in China and Brazil found that the majority of patients were female,  though in one study the majority of Chinese patients using acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation were male. == Aung &amp; Chen, 2007, p.  .  with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.    Apart from the usual filiform needle, there also other needle types which can be utilized, such as three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.   Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a technique adopted in China and the West).  Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.   ==InsertionSince most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended. If skilled enough, a practitioner purportedly can insert the needles without causing any pain. Both peer-reviewed medical journals, and acupuncture journals reviewed by acupuncturists, have published on the painfulness of acupuncture treatments, in some cases within the context of reporting studies testing acupuncture’s effectiveness.             A peer-reviewed medical journal on pain published an article stating that "acupuncture is a painful and unpleasant treatment".  There are other cases in which patients have found the insertion of needles in acupuncture too painful to endure.  An acupuncture journal, peer-reviewed by acupuncturists, published an article describing insertion of needles in TCM acupuncture and random needling acupuncture as “painful stimulation”.  In a peer-reviewed medical journal, one medical scientist published that Japanese acupuncture is “far less painful” than Chinese acupuncture, and that Japanese acupuncture needles are smaller than Chinese acupuncture needles. De-qi sensation vacuity patterns, repletion patterns. De qi is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment. ==   acute conditions chronic diseases.  Moxibustion could be direct (the cone was placed directly on the skin and allowed to burn the skin producing a blister and eventually a scar), or indirect (either a cone of mugwort was placed on a slice of garlic, ginger or other vegetable, or a cylinder of mugwort was held above the skin, close enough to either warm or burn it). *Fire cupping *Tuina (also known as acupressure) is a TCM method of attempting to stimulate the flow of qi by various bare handed techniques.  percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. meridian points on the body.

Professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Edzard Ernst and his colleagues have produced regular systematic reviews of the acupuncture literature. In 2007, they concluded that "the emerging clinical evidence seems to imply that acupuncture is effective for some but not all conditions."     Several review articles discussing the effectiveness of acupuncture have concluded that its effects may be due to placebo.    Evidence for the treatment of psychological conditions other than pain is equivocal.   Acupunctures greatest effectiveness appears to be in symptomatic control of pain and nausea.== complementary therapy for various conditions.  Braverman and other medical acupuncturists also stated that definitive conclusions based on research findings were rare because the state of acupuncture research is poor, but that it is improving.     CAM treatments, but no more effective than conventional and alternative treatments for short-term pain relief and improving function. However, when combined with other conventional therapies, the combination is slightly better than conventional therapy alone.     A review for the American Pain Society/American College of Physicians found fair evidence that acupuncture is effective for chronic low back pain.    Conducting research on low back pain is unusually problematic since most patients have experienced "conventional care" – which is itself relatively ineffective  – and have low expectations for it. As such, conventional care groups may not be an adequate scientific control and may even lead to nocebo effects that can further inflate of the apparent effectiveness of acupuncture.   There is moderate evidence that for neck pain, acupuncture is more likely to be effective than other CAM treatments and offers short-term improvement compared to those on a waiting list.  ;    This is tentatively supported by a recent review. There is evidence to support the use of acupuncture to treat headaches that are idiopathic, though the evidence is not conclusive and more studies need to be conducted.  Several trials have indicated that migraine patients benefit from acupuncture, although the correct placement of needles seems to be less relevant than is usually thought by acupuncturists. Overall in these trials acupuncture was associated with slightly better outcomes and fewer adverse effects than prophylactic drug treatment.  consensus recommendations in 2008 that concluded acupuncture may be useful for treating the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee.   Results for osteoarthritis in other joints suggest insignificant effects in short-term pain relief, which may be due to placebo or expectation effects. == patient blinding regarding receiving standard or nonstandard acupuncture.    A 2011 Cochrane Review on the treatment of vomiting after the start of chemotherapy concluded that acupuncture point stimulation with needles and electroacupuncture reduced the number times subjects vomited on the day of treatment, but were no help regarding immediate or delayed nausea.  Acupressure was found to reduce the short-term severity of nausea, but was no help over the long term and did not influence vomiting.  All of the experiments reviewed also used medication to control vomiting, though trials involving electroacupuncture did not use the newest drugs available.  statistically significant evidence that acupuncture could prevent PONV though comparison of the studies is difficult due to the use of varied methodologies (different patient groups, different ways of stimulating the P6 point such as a needle versus finger pressure versus a special bracelet, timing and length of application of pressure, the use of one versus both arms, whether a general anaesthetic was used, and the mixture of men and women in the studies).  The reviewer ultimately concluded that "due to the lack of robust studies,   found that neither acupressure nor acupuncture was effective in preventing or managing PONV in adults" and suggested further research to clarify issues such as the length and type of stimulation applied, training of those applying stimulation and gathering data, risk factors for PONV, inclusion of proper placebos, and the analysis of specific population.  The author also suggested disagreement with previous systemic reviews were due to their inclusion of older studies with poorer methodologies, while the more recent, better quality studies included in the review offered more negative results. ==Proponents believe acupuncture can assist with fertility, pregnancy and childbirth, attributing various conditions of health and difficulty with the flow of qi through various meridians.  Cochrane review egg was initially removed and the review did not recommend the routine use of acupuncture during the luteal phase until better trials were available.   A different review article published in 2010 found that there was no evidence acupuncture improved pregnancy rates irrespective of when it was performed and recommended against its use during in vitro fertilization either during egg retrieval or implantation.  == Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicines has a fully updated list of all the Cochrane Collaboration regarding acupuncture   and the overall conclusion is: ...the majority of the Cochrane reviews about acupuncture, acupressure, electroacupuncture and moxibustion   there exists no solid evidence to determine the effectiveness of the treatments. The reviews point out that many of the studies suffer from methodological defects and shortcomings. Furthermore, the number of trial subjects has been limited. Thus most of the overall conclusions are uncertain. For the following conditions, the Cochrane Collaboration or other review articles have concluded there is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is beneficial, often because of the paucity and poor quality of the research, and that further research is needed: * Chronic asthma   * Bells palsy   * Cocaine dependence    depression   * Drug detoxification       * Primary dysmenorrhoea (incorporating transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|TENS)   * Epilepsy   * Fibromyalgia   * Glaucoma,   * Insomnia   * Irritable bowel syndrome   * Induction of childbirth   * Rheumatoid arthritis   * Shoulder pain   * Schizophrenia   * Smoking cessation   * Acute stroke    and stroke rehabilitation   * Tennis elbow   * Vascular dementia    scientific research meridians has placebo control, etc.) the "more that researchers eliminate bias from their trials, the greater the tendency for results to indicate that acupuncture is little more than a placebo."   Also complicating reseach on acupuncture is the possibility of a strong publication bias from certain countries; a review of studies on acupuncture found that trials originating in China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan were uniformly favourable to acupuncture, as were ten out of 11 studies conducted in Russia. Different types of comparison are made in the scientific literature and terminology can vary, therefore care is needed when assessing research. “Acupuncture” may refer only to insertion of needles in traditionally determined acupuncture points; in which case, it is contrasted with randomly inserting needles, which is called a sham treatment, placebo, needling or medical acupuncture if the points are determined by anatomy and not by TCM. In some sources "acupuncture" refers to random needling with needle insertion, and this is compared to pressing telescoping needles against the skin at the same points but not puncturing the skin, which is called a "sham treatment" or "placebo".     The World Health Organization  and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH)  have stated that acupuncture can be effective in the treatment of neurological conditions and pain, though these statements have been criticized for bias and a reliance on studies that used poor methodology.   Reports from the USAs National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the American Medical Association (AMA) and various USA government reports have studied and commented on the efficacy of acupuncture. There is general agreement that acupuncture is safe when administered by well-trained practitioners using sterile needles, but not on its efficacy as a medical procedure.      Many research studies conclude that "further research is needed", but opinion is divided as to whether this is a good place to spend limited research funds.      ==The National Council Against Health Fraud stated in 1990 that acupuncture’s “theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge.”  In 1993 neurologist Arthur Taub called acupuncture “nonsense with needles.”  The website Quackwatch criticizes TCM as having unproven efficacy and an unsound scientific basis.    Physicist John P. Jackson,  Steven Salzberg, director of the Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and professor at the University of Maryland,  Yale University professor of neurology, and founder and executive editor of the blog Science Based Medicine, Steven Novella,  and Wallace Sampson, clinical professor emeritus of medicine at Stanford University and editor-in-chief at the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, have all characterized acupuncture as pseudoscience  or pseudomedical.  NIH consensus statement on acupuncture: Qi, acupuncture points and meridians  nuclear imaging have suggested that tracers may be used to follow meridians and are not related to veins or lymphatic tissues, but the interpretation of these results is unclear. The electrical resistance of acupuncture points and meridians have also been studied, with conflicting results. The meridians are part of the controversy in the efforts to reconcile acupuncture with conventional medicine. The National Institutes of Health 1997 consensus development statement on acupuncture stated that acupuncture points, Qi, the meridian system and related theories play an important role in the use of acupuncture, but are difficult to relate to a contemporary understanding of the body.  Chinese medicine forbade dissection, and as a result the understanding of how the body functioned was based on a system that related to the world around the body rather than its internal structures. The 365 "divisions" of the body were based on the number of days in a year, and the 12 meridians proposed in the TCM system are thought to be based on the 12 major rivers that run through China.   The ancient traditions of qi, yin, yang and meridians have no counterpart in modern studies of chemistry, biology, physics, or human physiology and to date scientists have been unable to find evidence that supports their existence.     Support for the existence of qi is often looked for in scientific fields such as bioelectricity    but this research is rarely verified and the connection with qi may be spurious.Research on the electrical activity of acupuncture points lacks a standardized methodology and reporting protocols, and is generally of poor quality. Acupuncturist   of longitude used in geography – an imaginary human construct.  Mann attempted to join up his medical knowledge with that of Chinese theory. In spite of his protestations about the theory, he was fascinated by it and trained many people in the west with the parts of it he borrowed. He also wrote many books on this subject. His legacy is that there is now a college in London and a system of needling that is known as "Medical Acupuncture". Today this college trains doctors and western medical professionals only. Reviewers Leonid Kalichman and Simon Vulfsons have described the use of dry needling of myofascial trigger points as an effective and low risk treatment modality.  A systematic review of acupuncture for pain found that there was no difference between inserting needles into "true" acupuncture on traditional acupuncture points versus "placebo" points not associated with any TCM acupuncture points or meridians. The review concluded that "A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias. Whether needling at acupuncture points, or at any site, reduces pain independently of the psychological impact of the treatment ritual is unclear." A history of medical science article published in the journal Biocommunications states that "the Chinese drew mystical numerical associations, called the Da shu, or “great numbers.” It was no coincidence to the ancient Chinese, for example, that our four limbs matched the number of seasons and directions, and that in the one record of a human dissection on the body of the rebel Wangsun Qing, the hired butchers of his captor, Wang Mang, reported finding five zang (liver, gall bladder, heart, spleen, kidneys) corresponding to the five planets; 12 vessels circulating blood and air corresponding to the 12 rivers flowing toward the Central Kingdom; and 365 parts of the body, one for each day of the year (Lingshu 13/311 ), and the Ling shu cited says “There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints (or acupoints)... There are 12 channel rivers across the land, while humans have 12 channel” – Ling Shu  A report for CSICOP on pseudoscience in China written by Wallace Sampson and Barry Beyerstein said:  }}== review articles discussing the effectiveness of acupuncture have concluded it is possible to explain through the placebo effect.    Despite consistently failing to find a difference between real and sham acupuncture, much of the literature on the topic has consistently failed to consider placebo effect as an explanation for apparent effectiveness.   Endorphin release, stimulation of the peripheral nervous system, and pain mediation through the effects of other neuropeptides are thought to be the most likely explanations for the effects of the insertion of needles.  Publication bias is a significant concern when evaluating the literature. Other claims of efficacy have not been tested. Reports from the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the American Medical Association (AMA) and various US government reports have studied and commented on the efficacy (or lack thereof) of acupuncture. There is general agreement that acupuncture is safe when administered by well-trained practitioners using sterile needles.     The neural mechanisms underlying minute pain relief from insertion of needles are unknown, but it has been suggested that it may involve recruitment of the bodys own pain reduction system, and an increased release of endorphins, serotonin, norepinephrine, or gamma-Aminobutyric acid.   == One of the major challenges in acupuncture research is in the design of an appropriate   modalities, it is similarly difficult to separate the effectiveness of the treatment from the effectiveness of the person providing the treatment."   Acupuncture itself is also a very strong placebo, and can provoke extremely high expectations from patients and test subjects; this is particularly problematic for health problems like chronic low back pain, where conventional treatment is often relatively ineffective and may have been unsuccessfully used in the past. In situations like these, it may be inappropriate to consider "conventional care" a proper control intervention for acupuncture since patient expectations for conventional care are quite low.   Blinding of the practitioner in acupuncture remains challenging. One proposed solution to blinding patients has been the development of "sham acupuncture", i.e., needling performed superficially or at non-acupuncture sites. Controversy remains over whether, and under what conditions, sham acupuncture may function as a true placebo, particularly in studies on  s showing larger effects of a superficial needle penetrating acupuncture than those of a nonpenetrating sham control, positron emission tomography research indicating that sham acupuncture can stimulate regions of the brain associated with natural opiate production, and animal studies showing that sham needle insertion can have nonspecific analgesic effects through a postulated mechanism of “diffuse noxious inhibitory control”. Indeed, superficial needle penetration is a common technique in many authentic traditional Japanese acupuncture styles."     When "placebo needles" (in which the needle retracts into a handle rather than penetrating the skin) were introduced to the study of acupuncture, the majority of studies conducted using these needles concluded the effects of acupuncture were due to placebo. An analysis of 13 studies of pain treatment with acupuncture, published in January 2009 in the journal BMJ, concluded there was little difference in the effect of real, sham and no acupuncture. ==In 1997, the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs stated:  pseudoscientific reasoning.     In 2006 the NIHs National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine stated that it continued to abide by the recommendations of the 1997 NIH consensus statement, even if research is still unable to explain its mechanism.  Beijing Medical the West Singh &amp; Ernst, 2008, p.  .   Ernst also described the statement in a 2006 peer reviewed article as "Perhaps the most obviously over-optimistic overview  ", noting that of the 35 conditions that the WHO stated acupuncture was effective for, 27 of the systematic reviews that the WHO report was based on found that acupuncture was not effective for treating the specified condition. The National Health Service of the United Kingdom states that there is "reasonably good evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment" for nausea, vomiting, osteoarthritis of the knee and several types of pain but "because of disagreements over the way acupuncture trials should be carried out and over what their results mean, this evidence does not allow us to draw definite conclusions". The NHS states there is evidence against acupuncture being useful for rheumatoid arthritis, smoking cessation and weight loss, and inadequate evidence for most other conditions that acupuncture is used for.    invasive procedures, and therefore not without risk. Injuries are rare among patients treated by trained practitioners in some countries.       Sometimes, needles are required by law to be Asepsis|sterile, disposable and used only once; in some places, needles may be reused if they are first resterilized, e.g. in an autoclave. When needles are contaminated, risk of bacterial or other blood-borne infection increases, as with re-use of any type of needle.   == case reports of injuries stated that "ninety-five cases of severe adverse effects including 5 fatalities" were evident in the literature reviewed. "Pneumothorax and infections were the most frequently reported adverse effects." ==Other risks of injury include: nerve injury, resulting from the accidental puncture of any nerve, brain damage or stroke, which is possible with very deep needling at the base of the skull,  kidney damage from deep needling in the low back. Haemopericardium, or puncture of the protective membrane surrounding the Human heart|heart, which may occur with needling over a sternal foramen. ==Receiving alternative medicine as a replacement for standard modern medical care could result in inadequate diagnosis or treatment of conditions for which modern medicine has a better treatment record.As with other alternative medicines, unethical or naïve practitioners may also induce patients to exhaust financial resources by pursuing ineffective treatment.
