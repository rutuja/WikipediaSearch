Like Achilles in a later generation, he was trained by the centaur Chiron.He fell to the fatal wrath of  , and what Artemis did: the hunter became the hunted; he was transformed into a stag, and his raging hounds, struck with a wolfs frenzy (Lyssa), tore him apart as they would a stag."  This is the iconic motif by which Actaeon is recognized, both in ancient art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance depictions.Among others, John Heath has observed, "The unalterable   — for the unlucky profanation of her virginitys mystery. Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately was changed into a stag. His own hounds then turned upon him and tore him to pieces, not recognizing him. An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger. In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their masters death, that Chiron made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.   Philip II (National Gallery of Scotland).]]There are various other versions of his transgression: The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women and pseudo-Apollodoran Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke state that his offense was that he was a rival of Zeus for Semele, his mothers sister,  whereas in Euripides Bacchae he has boasted that he is a better hunter than Artemis:  {||-----|: : : : |:Look at Actaeons wretched fate:who by the man-eating hounds he had raised,:was torn apart, better at hunting:than Artemis he had boasted to be, in the meadows.|}Further materials, including fragments that belong with the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women and at least four Attic tragedies, including a Toxotides  of Aeschylus, have been lost.  Diodorus Siculus (4.81.4), in a variant of Actaeons hubris that has been largely ignored, has it that Actaeon wanted to marry Artemis. Other authors say the hounds were Artemis own; some lost elaborations of the myth seem to have given them all names and narrated their wanderings after his loss.  s Bath of Diana (1558-59) Actaeons passing on horseback at left and mauling as a stag at right is incidental to the three female nudes.]]According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman Ovid  having accidentally seen Diana (Artemis) on Mount Cithaeron while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds.  This version also appears in Callimachus Fifth Hymn, as a mythical parallel to the blinding of Tiresias after he sees Athena bathing.  myth elements hero archegetes ("hero-founder")  The righteous hunter, the companion of Artemis, seeing her bathing naked at the spring, was moved to try to make himself her consort, as Diodorus Siculus noted, and was punished, in part for transgressing the hunters "ritually enforced deference to Artemis" (Lacy 1990:42).The following list is as given in Hyginus Fabulae.  The first part of the list is taken from Ovids Metamorphoses (Book III, 206 - 235), and the second from an unknown source. Note: In the first part of the list, Hyginus fails to correctly differentiate between masculine and feminine names.;According to OvidDogs: Melampus, Ichnobates,  , Pamphagos, Dorceus, Oribasus, Nebrophonus, Laelap, Theron, Pterelas, Hylaeus, Nape, Ladon, Poemenis,  , Aura, Lacon, Harpyia, Aello, Dromas, Thous Canache, Cyprius, Sticcte, Labros, Arcas, Agriodus, Tigris, Hylactor, Alce, Harpalus, Lycisca, Melaneus, Lachne, Leucon.Bitches: Melanchaetes, Agre, Theridamas, Oresitrophos.;Authors other than OvidDogs: Acamas, Syrus, Leon, Stilbon, Agrius, Charops, Aethon, Corus, Boreas, Draco, Eudromus, Dromius, Zephyrus, Lampus, Haemon, Cyllopodes, Harpalicus, Machimus, Ichneus, Melampus, Ocydromus, Borax, Ocythous, Pachylus, Obrimus;Bitches: Argo, Arethusa, Urania, Theriope, Dinomache, Dioxippe, Echione, Gorgo, Cyllo, Harpyia, Lynceste, Leaena, Lacaena, Ocypete, Ocydrome, Oxyrhoe, Orias, *Sagnos, Theriphone, *Volatos, *Chediaetros. Pausanias was shown a spring on the road in Attica leading to Plataea from Eleutherae, just beyond Megara "and a little farther on a rock. It is called the bed of Actaeon, for it is said that he slept thereon when weary with hunting, and that into this spring he looked while Artemis was bathing in it.  ]]In the standard version of the Epic of Gilgamesh (tablet vi) there is a parallel, in the series of examples Gilgamesh gives Ishtar of her mistreatment of her serial lovers: You loved the herdsman, shepherd and chief shepherd Who was always heaping up the glowing ashes for you, And cooked ewe-lambs for you every day. But you hit him and turned him into a wolf, His own herd-boys hunt him down And his dogs tear at his haunches.  Actaeon, torn apart by dogs incited by Artemis, finds another Near Eastern parallel in the Ugaritic hero Aqht, torn apart by eagles incited by Anath who wanted his hunting bow. The virginal Artemis of classical times is not directly comparable to Ishtar of the many lovers, but the   First Idyll. Aeschylus and other tragic poets made use of the story, which was a favourite subject in ancient works of art.* There is a well-known small marble group in the British Museum illustrative of the story,  in gallery 83/84.

His story is reliquished at this point, in favour of the other plots.* Ted Hughes wrote a version of the story in his Tales from Ovid. The Oxford Classical Dictionary, s.v.
