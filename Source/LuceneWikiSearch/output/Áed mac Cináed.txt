Ã�ed mac CinÃ¡eda Constantine I. He was nicknamed Ã�ed of the White Flowers, the Wing-footed ( ) or the white-foot ( ).The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says of Ã�ed: "Edus   held the same   for one year. The shortness of his reign has bequeathed nothing memorable to history. He was slain in the civitas of Nrurim." Nrurim is unidentified. New Statistical Account (1834&ndash;1845), has it that the early-historic mound of the Cunninghillock by Inverurie is the burial place of Ã�ed. This is based on reading Nrurim as Inruriu.A longer account is interpolated in Andrew of Wyntouns Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland. This says that Ã�ed reigned one year and was killed by his successor Giric in Strathallan and other king lists have the same report.It is uncertain which, if any, of the Prophecy of BerchÃ¡ns kings should be taken to be Ã�ed. William Forbes Skene presumed that the following verses referred to Ã�ed: 129. Another king will take  ; small is the profit that he does not divide. Alas for Scotland thenceforward. His name will be the Furious. 130. He will be but a short time over Scotland. The will be no   unplundered. Alas for Scotland, through the youth; alas for their books, alas for their bequests. 131. He will be nine years in the kingdom. I shall tell you&mdash;it will be a tale of truth&mdash;he dies without bell, with communion, at evening, in a fatal pass. Ã�eds son, ConstantÃ­n mac Ã�eda, became king in 900. The idea that Domnall II of Strathclyde was a son of Ã�ed, based on a confusing entry in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, is contested.Kingdom of Alba Alan Orr Anderson|Anderson, Alan Orr, Early Sources of Scottish History A.D 500&ndash;1286, volume 1.
