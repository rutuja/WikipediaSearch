Abba ArikaSura the systematic study of the rabbinic traditions, which, using the Mishnah as text, led to the compilation of the Talmud. With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia  , around the year 220. He is commonly known simply as Rav (or Rab, Hebrew language|Hebrew:  ). Judah I, was known simply as Rabbi. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the tannaitic literature (for instance, Tosefta, Beitzah  1:7), where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the Tannaim and the Amoraim, and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an  amora, of disputing the opinion of a tanna (Bava Batra  42a and elsewhere).Rav was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to Shimei, brother of King David (Sanhedrin 5a; Ketubot  62b). His father, Aibo, was a brother of Hiyya bar Abba|Chiyya, who lived in Palestine, and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch Judah I. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncles disciple and as a member of the academy at Sepphoris, Rav acquired such an extraordinary knowledge of traditional lore as to make him its foremost exponent in his native land. While Judah I was still living, Rav, having been duly ordained as teacherâ€”though not without certain restrictions (Sanhedrin 5a)â€”returned to Babylonia, where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism. Rabbi Shela made him lecturer (amora) of his college (Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra v. 15a; Yoma, 20b). Then he removed to Sura (city)|Sura, on the Euphrates, where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rav lived and worked in Sura until his death. Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel, another disciple of Judah I, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rav that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Ravs activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.The method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rav. That method takes the Mishnah of Judah ha-Nasi as a text or foundation, adding to it the other tannaitic traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Ravs name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the Babylonian Talmud. His numerous disciplesâ€”some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuelâ€”amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rav. In the Babylonian schools, Rav was rightly referred to as "our great master." Rav also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of marriage and divorce, and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of ritual observance. Jewish prayerbook, New Year. halakic and aggadistic utterances; and the Palestinian Midrashim also contain many of his aggadot. Rav delivered homiletic discourses, both in the Beth midrash (college) and in the synagogues. He especially loved to treat in his homilies of the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the aggadah, are his creations. His aggadah is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these utterances may be quoted here: (Shabbat 10b)*"The commandments of the Torah were only given to purify mens morals" (Genesis Raba 44).*"Whatever may not properly be done in public is forbidden even in the most secret chamber" (Shabbat 64b).*"It is well that people busy themselves with the study of the Law and the performance of charitable deeds, even when not entirely disinterested; for the habit of right-doing will finally make the intention pure" (Pesahim 50b).*"Man will be called to account for having deprived himself of the good things which the world offered" (Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin end).*"Whosoever hath not pity upon his fellow man is no child of Abraham" (Beitzah 32b).*"It is better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace than publicly to put to shame ones fellow creature" (Bava Metzia 59a).*"One should never betroth himself to a woman without having seen her; one might subsequently discover in her a blemish because of which one might loathe her and thus transgress the commandment: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Kiddushin 41a). Joseph shows what evil results may follow therefrom".Rav loved the Book of Ecclesiasticus (Sirach), and warned his disciple Hamnuna against unjustifiable asceticism by quoting advice contained thereinâ€”that, considering the transitoriness of human life (Eruvin 54a), one should not despise the good things of this world. To the celestial joys of the future he was accustomed to refer in the following poetic words: (Berakhot 17a):"There is naught on earth to compare with the future life. In the world to come there shall be neither eating nor drinking, neither trading nor toil, neither hatred nor envy; but the righteous shall sit with crowns upon their heads, and rejoice in the radiance of the Divine Presence". mystical and transcendental speculations Divine Name. Many of his important utterances testify to his tendency in this direction (Hagigah 12a, Kiddushin 71a).Concerning the social position and the personal history of Rav we were not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (Hullin 105a). That he was highly respected by the  . Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of exilarch (resh galuta) (Hullin 92a).Rav died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism (Shabbat 110a, Moed Katan 24a).  * .
