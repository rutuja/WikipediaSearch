Several concepts that provide alternative definitions for the reaction mechanisms involved and their application in solving related problems exist. Despite several differences in definitions, their importance becomes apparent as different methods of analysis when applied to acid–base reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent. The first of these scientific concepts of acids and bases was provided by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, circa 1776. Miessler, G.L., Tarr, D. A., "Inorganic Chemistry" (1991) p. 166 – Table of discoveries attributes Antoine Lavoisier as the first to posit a scientific theory in relation to oxyacids. == oxidation states hydrohalic acids Greek οξυς Sir Humphry H 2 H 2 Te, and the hydrohalic acids. However, Davy failed to develop a new theory, concluding that "acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance, but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances".    One notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by Berzelius, who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals.==This definition was proposed by Justus von Liebig circa 1838, Miessler, G. L., Tarr, D. A., (1991) "Inorganic Chemistry" 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall p. 166 – table of discoveries attributes Justus von Liebigs publication as 1838  based on his extensive works on the chemical composition of organic acids. This finished the doctrinal shift from oxygen-based acids to hydrogen-based acids, started by Davy. According to Liebig, an acid is a hydrogen-containing substance in which the hydrogen could be replaced by a metal.    Liebigs definition, while completely empirical, remained in use for almost 50 years until the adoption of the Arrhenius definition. H. L. Finston and A. C. Rychtman, A New View of Current Acid-Base Theories, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1983, pp. 140–146. == The Arrhenius definition of acid–base reactions is a development of the hydrogen theory of acids, devised by Svante Arrhenius, which was used to provide a modern definition of acids and bases that followed from his work with Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in establishing the presence of ions in aqueous solution in 1884, and led to Arrhenius receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for "recognition of the extraordinary services... rendered to the advancement of chemistry by his electrolytic theory of dissociation". Miessler, G. L., Tarr, D. A., (1991) "Inorganic Chemistry" 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall p. 165  dissociate in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions ( ),  and Arrhenius bases, which form hydroxide ( ) ions. More recent IUPAC recommendations now suggest the newer term "hydronium"  be used in favor of the older accepted term "oxonium" International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (2006) IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, Electronic version Retrieved from International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry on 9 May 2007 on URL http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04379.html "Oxonium Ions"  to illustrate reaction mechanisms such as those defined in the Brønsted–Lowry and solvent system definitions more clearly, with the Arrhenius definition serving as a simple general outline of acid–base character.  The Arrhenius definition can be summarised as "Arrhenius acids form hydrogen ions in aqueous solution with Arrhenius bases forming hydroxide ions."The universal aqueous acid–base definition of the Arrhenius concept is described as the formation of water from hydrogen and hydroxide ions, or hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions from the dissociation of an acid and base in aqueous solution::  (aq) +   (aq)    (In modern times, the use of   is regarded as a shorthand for hydronium| , since it is now known that the bare proton   does not exist as a free species in solution.)  neutralization reaction.:acid + base → salt + water moles of sodium ion ( ) from the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) combine with one mole of sulfate ion ( ) from sulfuric acid ( ) to form one mole of sodium sulfate ( ) . Two moles of water are also formed.:2 NaOH +   →   + 2  The Arrhenius definitions of acidity and alkalinity are restricted to aqueous solutions, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. Under this definition, pure   or HCl dissolved in toluene are not acidic, and molten KOH and solutions of sodium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline.==One of the limitations of Arrhenius definition was its reliance on water solutions. Edward C. Franklin studied the acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to water-based Arrhenius theory, and Albert F. O. Germann, working with liquid  , generalized Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents and formulated the solvent system theory in 1925. Germann pointed out that in many solvents there is a certain concentration of a positive species, solvonium (earlier lyonium) cations and negative species, solvate (earlier lyate) anions, in equilibrium with the neutral solvent molecules. For example, water and ammonia undergo such dissociation into hydronium and hydroxide, and ammonium and amide, respectively:: 2       +  : 2       +  Some aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation, such as dinitrogen tetroxide into nitrosonium and nitrate, antimony trichloride into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate, and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and chloride.:       +  : 2       +  :       +  A solute causing an increase in the concentration of the solvonium ions and a decrease in the solvate ions is defined as an acid and one causing the reverse is defined as a base. Thus, in liquid ammonia,   (supplying  ) is a strong base, and   (supplying  ) is a strong acid. In liquid sulfur dioxide ( ), thionyl compounds (supplying  ) behave as acids, and sulfites (supplying  ) behave as bases.The non-aqueous acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water:: 2   (base) +   (amphiphilic amide) →  : 2   (acid) +   (amphiphilic amide) →  Nitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid::   (base) + 2   →   +   + 2  The unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents, for example in liquid  ::   (base) +   (acid) →   (solvent) +   (salt)Since solvent-system definition depends on the solvent as well as on the compound itself, the same compound can change its role depending on the choice of the solvent. Thus,   is a strong acid in water, a weak acid in acetic acid, and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid. This was seen as both a strength and a weakness, since some substances, such as   and  , were felt to be acidic or basic on their own right. On the other hand, solvent system theory was criticized as too general to be useful; it was felt that there is something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen compounds, not shared by non-hydrogenic solvonium salts. ==  protons to bases, which "accept" them. Miessler, G. L., Tarr, D. A., (1991) "Inorganic Chemistry" 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall pp. 167–169 – According to this page, the original definition was that "acids have a tendency to lose a proton"  Unlike the previous definitions, the Brønsted–Lowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent, but instead to the formation of conjugate acids and conjugate bases, produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base.   In this approach, acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts, which are seen as electrolytes, subject to the theories of Peter Debye|Debye, Lars Onsager|Onsager, and others. An acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent, but to form a new acid and a new base. The concept of neutralization is thus absent. According to Brønsted–Lowry definition, an acid is a compound that can donate a proton, and a base is a compound that can receive a proton. An acid–base reaction is, thus, the removal of a hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition to the base. Clayden, J., Warren, S., et al. (2000) "Organic Chemistry" Oxford University Press pp. 182–184  This does not refer to the removal of a proton from the nucleus of an atom, which would require levels of energy not attainable through the simple dissociation of acids, but to removal of a hydrogen ion ( ).The removal of a proton (hydrogen ion) from an acid produces its conjugate base, which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed, and the reception of a proton by a base produces its conjugate acid, which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.For example, the removal of   from hydrochloric acid (HCl) produces the chloride ion ( ), the conjugate base of the acid::  →   +  The addition of   to the hydroxide ion ( ), a base, produces water ( ), its conjugate acid::  +   →  Although Brønsted–Lowry acid–base behavior is formally independent of any solvent, it encompasses Arrhenius and solvent system definitions in an unenforced way. For example, protonation of ammonia, a base, gives ammonium ion, its conjugate acid::  +   →  The reaction of ammonia, a base, with acetic acid in absence of water can be described to give ammonium cation, an acid, and acetate anion, a base::  +   →   +  This definition also explains the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions::  +       +  Water, being amphoteric, can act as both an acid and a base; here, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating a   ion and forming the conjugate base,  , and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the   ion and forming the conjugate acid,  .Acid dissociation and acid hydrolysis are seen to be entirely similar phenomena:: HCl (acid) +   (base)     (acid) +   (base):   (acid) +   (base)     (acid) +   (base)as are basic dissociation and basic hydrolysis::   (base) +   (acid)     (acid) +   (base):   (base) +   (acid)     (acid) +   (base) Thus, the general formula for acid–base reactions according to the Brønsted–Lowry definition is::AH + B →   +  where AH represents the acid, B represents the base,   represents the conjugate acid of B, and   represents the conjugate base of AH.Although Brønsted–Lowry calls hydrogen-containing substances like   acids,   and   are not bases but salts containing the bases   and  . Also, some substances, which many chemists considered to be acids, such as   or  , are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen. Gilbert Lewis wrote in 1938, "To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen." == The hydrogen requirement of Arrhenius and Brønsted–Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid–base reactions, devised by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1923, Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) "Inorganic Chemistry" 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall p. 166 – Table of discoveries attributes the date of publication/release for the Lewis theory as 1923.  in the same year as Brønsted–Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938.  Instead of defining acid–base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a Lewis base) to be a compound that can donate an electron pair, and an acid (a Lewis acid) to be a compound that can receive this electron pair. Miessler, G. L., Tarr, D. A., (1991) "Inorganic Chemistry" 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall pp. 170–172 In this system, an acid does not exchange atoms with a base, but combines with it. For example, consider this classical aqueous acid–base reaction::  (aq) +   (aq) →   (l) +   (aq)The Lewis definition does not regard this reaction as the formation of salt and water or the transfer of   from HCl to  . Instead, it regards the acid to be the   ion itself, and the base to be the   ion, which has an unshared electron pair. Therefore, the acid–base reaction here, according to the Lewis definition, is the donation of the electron pair from   to the   ion. This forms a covalent bond between   and  , thus producing water ( ).By treating acid–base reactions in terms of electron pairs instead of specific substances, the Lewis definition can be applied to reactions that do not fall under other definitions of acid–base reactions. For example, a silver cation behaves as an acid with respect to ammonia, which behaves as a base, in the following reaction::   + 2 :  →  :Ag: The result of this reaction is the formation of an ammonia–silver adduct. electronegative element pulls electrons towards its own orbitals, providing a more positive charge on the less-electronegative element and a difference in its electronic structure due to the axial or equatorial orbiting positions of its electrons, causing repulsive effects from lone pair – bonding pair (Lp–Bp) interactions between bonded atoms in excess of those already provided by bonding pair – bonding pair (Bp–Bp) interactions.  Adducts involving metal ions are referred to as co-ordination compounds. ==Simultaneously with Lewis, a Soviet chemist Mikhail Usanovich from Tashkent, developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogen-containing compounds, but his approach, published in 1938, was even more general than Lewis theory.  Usanovichs theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones, and a base as the reverse. This pushed the concept of acid–base reactions to its logical limits, and even redefined the concept of redox (oxidation-reduction) as a special case of acid-base reactions, and so did not become widespread, despite being easier to understand than Lewis theory, which required detailed familiarity with atomic structure.Some examples of Usanovich acid-base reactions include::   (base) +   (acid) → 2   +   (species exchanged: anion  ): 3   (base) +   (acid) → 6   + 2   (species exchanged: anion  ): Na (base) + Cl (acid) →   +   (species exchanged: electron)==This acid–base theory was a revival of oxygen theory of acids and bases, proposed by German chemist Hermann Lux     in 1939, further improved by Håkon Flood circa 1947    and is still used in modern geochemistry and electrochemistry of molten salts. This definition describes an acid as an oxide ion ( ) acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor. For example:   :   (base) +   (acid) →  :   (base) +   (acid) →  :   (base) +   (acid) →   + 2  ==  Hard Soft Acid Base principle, later made quantitative with help of Robert Parr in 1984. Hard applies to species that are small, have high charge states, and are weakly polarizable. Soft applies to species that are large, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable. Acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard–hard and soft–soft. This theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry.   metal salt neutralization reaction.In general, acid–alkali reactions can be simplified to:hydroxide| (aq) +  (aq) → water (molecule)| by omitting spectator ions. hydrogen ions ( ) or cause them to be produced in solutions. Hydrochloric acid ( ) and sulfuric acid ( ) are common examples. In water, these break apart into ions::  →  (aq) +  (aq):  →  (aq) +  (aq)An alkali is a base, a base that contains a metal from column 1 or 2 of the periodic table (the alkali metals or the alkaline earth metals). Alkalis may be defined as soluble bases, which means they must be able to dissolve in water. In general, bases are defined as substances that contain hydroxide ion ( ) or produce it in solution. Therefore, one may also speak of hydroxide bases that dissolve in water, and thus these would also be alkalis. Some examples, then, of alkalis would be sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2 ), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ). Note that only hydroxides with an alkali metal  —column 1 — are very soluble in water; hydroxides with an alkaline earth metal — column 2 — are not as soluble. Some sources  will even say the alkaline earth metal hydroxides are insoluble.To produce hydroxide ions in water, the alkali breaks apart into ions as below::  →  (aq) +  (aq)However, alkalies may also have a broader definition that includes carbonates ( ) bonded to a column 1 metal, an ammonium ion ( ), or an amine (NH x  radical) as the positive ion. Examples of alkalis would then also include  ,  , and (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 .There seems to be conflicting information on whether acid-base reactions are neutralization reactions. Some sources define a neutralization reaction as the reaction between an acid and a base that produces a salt and water. Yet, in the book Chemical Misconceptions: Prevention, Diagnosis and Cure by K. Tabor (2002), it is noted that “the term neutralization is usually reserved for acid–alkali reactions.” Thus, this does not make acid–alkali a type of neutralization reaction, but the only kind of neutralization reaction.There are many uses of neutralization reactions that are acid-alkali reactions. A very common use is antacid tablets. These are designed to neutralize excess stomach acid (HCl) that may be causing discomfort in the stomach or lower esophagus. Also in the digestive tract, neutralization reactions are used when food is moved from the stomach to the intestines. In order for the nutrients to be absorbed through the intestinal wall, an alkaline environment is needed, so the pancreas produce an antacid bicarbonate to cause this transformation to occur. Another common use, though perhaps not as widely known, is in fertilizers and control of soil pH. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or limestone (calcium carbonate) may be worked into soil that is too acidic for plant growth.  Fertilizers that improve plant growth are made by neutralizing sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) or nitric acid (HNO 3 ) with ammonia gas (NH 3 ), making ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate. These are salts utilized in the fertilizer. Industrially, a by-product of the burning of coal, sulfur dioxide gas may combine with water vapor in the air to eventually produce sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain. To prevent the sulfur dioxide from being released, a device known as a scrubber gleans the gas from smoke stacks. This device first blows calcium carbonate into the combustion chamber where it decomposes into calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide. This lime then reacts with the sulfur dioxide produced forming calcium sulfite. A suspension of lime is then injected into the mixture to produce a slurry, which removes the calcium sulfite and any remaining unreacted sulfur dioxide.
