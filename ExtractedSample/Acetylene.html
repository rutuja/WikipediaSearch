It is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne.   This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block.  It is unstable in pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution.   unsaturated because bonded together in a triple bond.  The carbon-carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°. Since acetylene is a linear symmetrical molecule, it possesses the D ∞h  point group.  carbon arc. Today acetylene is mainly manufactured by the partial  s. It is selectively hydrogenated into ethylene, usually using Pd-Ag catalysts. Until the 1950s, when oil supplanted coal as the chief source of carbon, acetylene (and the aromatic fraction from coal tar) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry. It was prepared by the hydrolysis of calcium carbide, a reaction discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in 1862 and still familiar to students:: CaC 2  + 2H 2 O → Ca(OH) 2  + C 2 H 2 Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000&amp;nbsp;°C, necessitating the use of an electric arc furnace. In the US, this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive hydroelectric power project at Niagara Falls.   orbital Orbital hybridizes with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two ends of the two sp hybrid orbital overlap to form a strong Sigma bond|σ valence bond between the carbons, while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker pi bond|π valence bonds.  One new application is the conversion of acetylene to ethylene for use in making a variety of polyethylene plastics.  An important reaction of acetylene is its combustion, the basis of the acetylene welding technologies.  Otherwise, its major applications involve its conversion to acrylic acid derivatives.  THF to give lithium acetylide.     :   heavy metals are easily formed by reaction of acetylene with the metal ions.  Several, e.g., silver acetylide (Ag 2 C 2 ) and copper acetylide (Cu 2 C 2 ), are powerful and very dangerous explosives. ==Walter Reppe discovered that in the presence of metal catalysts, acetylene can react to give a wide range of industrially significant chemicals.  * With alcohols, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride, or carboxylic acids to give vinyl compounds: :  * With aldehydes to give ethynyl diols. : :1,4-Butynediol is produced industrially in this way from formaldehyde and acetylene.* With carbon monoxide to give acrylic acid, or acrylic esters, which can be used to produce acrylic glass. : : * Cyclicization to give benzene and cyclooctatetraene: : : ==Approximately 20 percent of acetylene is consumed for   at 4798&amp;nbsp;K (4525&amp;nbsp;°C, 8180&amp;nbsp;°F) and  ]]== hydration of acetylene to acetaldehyde using catalysts such as mercury(II) bromide. Before the advent of the Wacker process, this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale. The polymerization of acetylene with Ziegler-Natta catalysts produces polyacetylene films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, was the one of first discovered organic semiconductors.  Its reaction with iodine produces a highly electrically conducting material.  Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of organic semiconductors, as recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 to Alan J. Heeger, Alan G MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa. In the early 20th Century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns.  Most early automobiles used carbide lamps before the adoption of electric headlights.Acetylene is sometimes used for carburization (that is, hardening) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace. Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in radiocarbon dating. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with lithium metal in a small specialized research furnace to form lithium carbide (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to be fed into mass spectrometer to sort out the isotopic ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12.  Acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe, often associated with the atmospheres of gas giants.  One curious discovery of acetylene is on Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. Natural acetylene is believed to form from either catalytic decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of 1,770&amp;nbsp;K and above. Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry.  Acetylene is not especially toxic but when generated from calcium carbide it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine. It is also highly flammable (hence its use in welding). Its singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized. Samples of concentrated or pure acetylene can easily react in an addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically benzene and/or vinylacetylene. This reaction is exothermic. Consequently, acetylene can explode with extreme violence if the pressure of the gas exceeds about 200&amp;nbsp;kPa (29&amp;nbsp;psi) as a gas   or when in liquid or solid form.  It is therefore shipped and stored dissolved in acetone or dimethylformamide (DMF), contained in a metal cylinder with a porous filling (Agamassan), which renders it safe to transport and use, given proper handling.   *  *</body></html>
