ACF Fiorentina Italian football club from Florence, Tuscany. Founded by a merger in 1926, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more Serie A seasons.  Italian Championships, European stage, Real Madrid, and also came close to winning the UEFA Cup, finishing as runners-up in the 1989â€“90 UEFA Cup|1989â€“90 season.Since 1931, the club have played at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, which currently has a capacity of 47,282. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname Viola, a reference to their distinctive purple colours. ==  CS Firenze PG Libertas. Northwest Italy. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of Calcio Fiorentino, an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the Medici family.  Stadio Artemio Franchi.  At the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. In order to be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the Uruguayan Pedro Petrone, nicknamed el Artillero. Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941 they won their first Coppa Italia, but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles.==  Julinho and Milan beat European Cup Real Madrid.Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the Serie A 1960-61|1960â€“61 season the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first Cup Winners Cup against Rangers F.C.|Rangers.After several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from 4th to 6th place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the Mitropa Cup in 1966.== , former captain of Fiorentina]] Milan as Bologna and Milan fell European Cup, and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot, but after losing against Juventus, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juventus in Turin on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the USSR against Dynamo Kyiv, but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter finals after a 3â€“0 defeat in Glasgow to Celtic FC|Celtic.Viola players began the 1970s decade with Scudetto sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a 5th place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The Viola did win the Anglo-Italian League Cup in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all Giancarlo Antognoni, who would later become an idol to Fiorentinas fans.  The young average age of the players led to the team being called Fiorentina Ye-Ye.==  Monza and a young Pietro Vierchowod from Sampdoria. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in Serie A 1981-82 Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rival Juventus. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season, when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty, and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.The following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, El Puntero RamÃ³n DÃ­az and, most significantly, the young Roberto Baggio.In 1990 Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the   (Fiorentinas home ground was suspended), a city with a lot of Juventus fans, and Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final.  Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florences streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker Mario Cecchi Gori.== , one of the most prominent Fiorentina players of the 1990s]]The first season under Cecchi Goris ownership was one of stabilization, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like Brian Laudrup, Stefan Effenberg, Francesco Baiano and, most importantly, Gabriel Batistuta, who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Mario Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son Vittorio Cecchi Gori. Despite a good start to the season, Vittorio Cecchi Gori fired the coach, Luigi Radice,  after a defeat against Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta,  and replaced him with Aldo Agroppi. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season. Rui Costa Benfica and the new world champion Brazilian defender MÃ¡rcio Roberto dos Santos|MÃ¡rcio Santos. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season.  Viola finished the season in 10th. AC Milan 2â€“1 at the San Siro.Fiorentinas 95â€“96 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the Cup Winners Cup semi-final by beating Gloria Bistrita, Sparta Prague, and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, FC Barcelona (Away 1â€“1, Home 0â€“2). The seasons main signings were Luis Oliveira|LuÃ­s Oliveira and Andrei Kanchelskis, the latter of whom suffered a lot of injuries. Arsenal 1â€“0 Wembley Stadium Manchester United 2â€“0 in Florence. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.At the end of the season Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach Fatih Terim. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to A.S. Roma|Roma, who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in Serie A 2000-01|2000â€“01 and stayed in the top half of Serie A, despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of Roberto Mancini. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the clubs finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around USD 50 million. The clubs owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the Serie A 2001-02|2001â€“02 season and went into judicially controlled administration in June 2002. This form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the Serie A 2002-03|2002â€“03 season, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.==The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner, and was admitted into Serie C2, the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was Angelo Di Livio, whose commitment to clubs cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker Christian RiganÃ², the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to Serie C1. However, due to the bizarre Calcio_Catania#Decline_and_revival|Caso Catania (Catania Case) the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B, something that was only made possible by the Italian Football Federations decision to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for "sports merits".  In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina. , the clubs longest-serving manager (2005â€“2010)]] playoff against Perugia (the Bologna and Parma F.C.|Parma.

Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since Antonio Valentin Angelillo in the Serie A 1958-59|1958â€“59 season, for which he was awarded the European Golden Boot. 2006 Serie UEFA Champions League place was also rescinded.  After the start of the season Fiorentinas penalization was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts.Despite starting the 2006â€“07 season with a 15-point penalty, Fiorentina nevertheless managed to secure a place in the 2007â€“08 edition of the UEFA Cup. The combination of Toni and Adrian Mutu proved to be one of Serie As most proficient strike partnerships, scoring 31 goals between them. UEFA Cup, Rangers on AC Milan. That campaign ended in the group stages, however, with the club finishing third and securing a path to the UEFA Cup instead.The 2008â€“09 season continued this success, a fourth place finish assuring Fiorentinas spot in 2010s Champions League playoffs. The Viola also took part to the 2008â€“09 UEFA Champions League, reaching the group phase after defeating Slavia Prague in the third qualifying round, but the club did not manage to qualify to the knockout rounds and was successively eliminated from the 2008â€“09 UEFA Cup too. In contrast to their Champions League campaign, La Viola remained in the top tier of the domestic league. , the Violas emerging young talent]] Inter along Juventus and Sampdoria earlier Sporting in Liverpool and Bayern Munich due to away goals, in a controversial double encounter involving what was considered as poor refereeing. Tom Henning Ã˜vrebÃ¸, who led the first leg in Germany, was then lambasted by journalists and Italian footballing figures for his decisions, most notably allowing a Miroslav Klose offside goal (that eventually fired Bayern through the next round), calling into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Fiorentina also maintained a strong Coppa Italia campaign, reaching the semifinal before being defeated by the eventual winner Inter. The domestic season ended on a sour note as the Viola failed to reach a European position. During this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of ACF Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentinas vice president until a permanent position could be filled.

The first one was nothing more than the citys coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylized fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about twenty years, had been a white lozenge with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the scudetto.The logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting  of one half of the city of Florences emblem and one half of the letter "F", for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a halberd than a fleur-de-lis. Todays logo is a kite shaped double lozenge bordered in gold. The outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters "AC" in white and the letter "F" in red, standing for the clubs name. The inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of Florence.    This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldnt use the same logo. Florences comune instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylized coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of euro|â‚¬2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.==When Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem.  The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname La Viola ("The Purple (team)"). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.  lilies on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts (97â€“98, 99â€“00 and 10â€“11) and a sterling version, mostly in the Coppa Italia, in 2000â€“01.Kit evolution{||||||} Italy 1934) Spain 1982) Spain 1982) Spain 1982) Spain 1982) Spain 1982) Mexico 1986) Germany 2006) Germany 2006)==Serie A::*Winners (2) : Serie A 1955â€“56|1955â€“56; Serie A 1968â€“69|1968â€“69:*Runners-up (5): 1956â€“57, 1957â€“58, 1958â€“59, 1959â€“60, 1981â€“82Coppa Italia::*Winners (6) : 1939â€“40; 1960â€“61; 1965â€“66; 1974â€“75; Coppa Italia 1995â€“96|1995â€“96; Coppa Italia 2000â€“01|2000â€“01:*Runners-up (3): 1958, 1959â€“60, 1998â€“99Supercoppa Italiana::*Winners (1) : 1996:*Runners-up (1): 2001==European Cup/ UEFA Champions League::*Runners-up (1): 1956â€“57 European Cup|1956â€“57UEFA Cup Winners Cup::*Winners (1) : 1960â€“61 European Cup Winners Cup|1960â€“61 :*Runners-up (1): 1961â€“62 European Cup Winners Cup|1961â€“62UEFA Cup/ UEFA Europa League::*Runners-up (1): 1989â€“90 UEFA Cup|1989â€“90==Mitropa Cup:*Winners (1) : 1966Anglo-Italian League Cup:*Winners (1) : 1975Serie B:*Winners: Serie B 1930â€“31|1930â€“31; Serie B 1938â€“39|1938â€“39; Serie B 1993â€“94|1993â€“94 Serie C2 (as Florentia Viola):*Winners: 2002â€“03     *
