He was the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the second half of the 12th century, and was the closest advisor of King Valdemar I of Denmark. He was a key figure in the Danish policies of territorial expansion in the Baltic Sea, Europeanization in close relationship with the Holy See, and reform in the relation between the Church and the public. He combined the ideals of Gregorian Reform ideals with loyal support of a strong monarchical power.Absalon was born into the powerful Hvide clan, and owned great land possessions. He endowed several church institutions, most prominently his familys Sorø Abbey. He was granted lands by the crown, and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day Copenhagen. His titles were passed on to his nephews Anders Sunesen and Peder Sunesen. He died in 1201, and was interred at Sorø Abbey.Absalon was born around 1128. Due to a name which is unusual in Denmark, it is speculated that he was christened on the Danish "Absalon"  .   and the young prince Valdemar, who later became King Valdemar I of Denmark.  During the civil war following the death of Eric III of Denmark in 1146, Absalon travelled abroad to study theology in Paris, while Esbern fought for Valdemars ascension to the throne. At Paris, he was influenced by the Gregorian Reform ideals of churchly independence from Monarchical rule. "Gads Historieleksikon", 3rd edition, 2006. Paul Ulff-Møller, "Absalon", p.10.

Absalon first appears in  , June 20, 2009 Absalon was a close counsellor of Valdemar, and chief promotor of the Danish crusades against the Wends.  During the Danish civil war, Denmark had been open to coastal raids by the Wends.  It was Absalons intention to clear the Baltic Sea of the Wendish pirates who inhabited its southern littoral zone which was later called Pomerania. The pirates had raided the Danish coasts during the civil war of Sweyn III, Canute V, and Valdemar, to the point where at the accession of Valdemar one-third of Denmark lay wasted and depopulated.  Absalon formed a guardian fleet, built coastal defenses, and led several campaigns against the Wends.  He even advocated forgiving the earlier enemies of Valdemar, which helped stabilize Denmark internally. == : Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona in 1169.]]The first expedition against the Wends that was conducted by Absalon in person, set out in 1160.  These expeditions were successful, but brought no lasting victories.  What started out as mere retribution, eventually evolved into full-fledged campaigns of expansion with religious crusader motives.  In 1164 began twenty years of crusades against the Wends, sometimes with the help of German duke Henry the Lion, sometimes in opposition to him.  Arkona in Bishop Sweyn Garz was then baptized, and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of Rügen.  Rügen was then subjected to Absalons Bishopric of Roskilde. The destruction of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably to reduce the Danish fleet.  But he continued to keep a watchful eye over the Baltic, and in 1170 destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at Dziwnów on the isle of Wolin. Absalons last military exploit came in 1184, off Stralsund at Whitsun, when he soundly defeated a Pomeranian fleet that had attacked Denmarks vassal, Jaromir of Rügen. == schism between Antipope Victor Frederick Barberossa Dole in 1162.  When Valdemar returned to Denmark, he was convinced into strengthening the Danevirke fortifications at the German border, with the support of Absalon. Absalon built churches and monasteries, supporting international religious orders like the Cistercians and Augustinians, founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment.  In 1162, Absalon transformed the Sorø Abbey of his family from Benedictine to Cistercian, granting it lands from his personal holdings. In 1167, Absalon was granted the land around the city of "Havn" ( ), and built there a castle in the coastal defense against the Wends.  Havn quickly expanded as one of Scandinavias most important centers of trade, and eventually evolved into modern-day Copenhagen.  It was also Absalon who held the first Danish Synod at Lund in 1167.  He was also interested in history and culture, and commissioned Saxo Grammaticus to write Gesta Danorum, a comprehensive chronicle of the history of the Danes.  In 1171, Absalon issued the "Zealand church law" ( ), which reduced the number of Canonical Law offenses for which the church could fine the public, while instituting the tithe payment system. Eventual violation of the law was specified as subject to a secular legal process.  canonizing Valdemars ombudsmen from liturgic remnants in favour of Papal standards.  A rebellion in the Scanian peasantry forced him to flee to Zealand in 1180, from where he returned and subdued the Scanians with the help of Valdemar.   Canute VI, and Absalon served as Canute VIs counsellor.  Under Canute VI, Absalon was the chief policymaker in Danish politics.  Absalon kept his hostile attitude to the Holy Roman Empire. On the accession of Canute VI in 1182, an imperial ambassador arrived at Roskilde to the new king swear fealty to Frederick Barberossa, but Absalon resolutely withstood him.  This represented the final Danish rejection of German supremacy. ==  Valdemar II. He instead confined himself to the administration of the Danish empire.  In 1192, Absalon made his nephew Peder Sunesen his successor as Bishop of Roskilde, while his other nephew Anders Sunesen was named the chancellor of Canute VI.  Absalon died at Sorø Abbey on March 21, 1201, 73 years old, with his last will granting his personal holdings to the Abbey, apart from Fjenneslev which went to Esbern Snarre. He had already given Copenhagen to the Bishopric of Roskilde.  Absalon was interred at Sorø Abbey,  and was succeeded as Archbishop of Lund by Anders Sunesen. Saxo Grammaticus Gesta Danorum was not finished until after the death of Absalon,  but Absalon was one of the chief heroic figures of the chronicle, which was to be the main source of knowledge about early Danish history.  Absalon left a legacy as the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the 12th century.   at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi  Absalon was equally great as churchman, statesman and warrior. His policy of expansion was to give Denmark the dominion of the Baltic for three generations. That he enjoyed warfare there can be no doubt; yet he was not like the ordinary fighting bishops of the Middle Ages, whose sole indication of their religious role was to avoid the shedding of blood by using a mace in battle instead of a sword.  Absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties, and even his wars were of the nature of crusades. In the 2000s, "Absalon" was adopted as the name for a class of Royal Danish Navy vessels, and the lead vessel of the class. HDMS Absalon (L16) and Esbern Snare (L17) were launched and commissioned by Denmark in 2004 and 2005.   In December 2008, HDMS Absalon was involved in the rescue of putative Somali pirates 90 miles off Yemen in the Gulf of Aden. The craft from Somalia was reported to hold rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, and to have been adrift for several days. Also per the report, the Absalon took the sailors and weapons aboard, sunk the craft, and turned the sailors over to the Yemen coast guard. The Absalon, according to The New York Times report, "was deployed in the Gulf of Aden   September   as part of an international effort to curb piracy,"   part of Combined Task Force 150.
