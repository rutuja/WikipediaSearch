It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter Alpha, from which it derives.The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also called aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet  (which, by consisting entirely of consonants, is an abjad rather than a true alphabet). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in Egyptian hieroglyphs. {| class="wikitable"|- style="background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;"! Egyptian! Phoenician  aleph!

In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set. Etruscan alphabet Latin alphabet used to write many languages, including English language|English.  minuscule (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke ( ), called Latin alpha or "script a". This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.  Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ( ). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. The letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds. In English, "a" by itself frequently denotes the near-open front unrounded vowel ( ) as in pad; the open back unrounded vowel ( ) as in father, its original, Latin and Greek, sound; a closer, further fronted sound as in "hare", which developed as the sound progressed from "father" to "ace";  in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong   as in ace and major, due to effects of the great vowel shift; the more rounded form in "water" or its closely related cousin, found in "was". In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, "a" denotes an  , variants of "a" denote various vowels. In X-SAMPA, capital "A" denotes the open back unrounded vowel and lowercase "a" denotes the open front unrounded vowel. Spanish and French language|French.
