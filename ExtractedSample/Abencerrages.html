Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian|J. P. de Florians Gonsalve de Cordoue and François-René de Chateaubriand|Châteaubriands Le dernier des Abencerrages are imitations of Perez de Hitas work.The story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The king, enraged, shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the Alhambra, and ordered the Zergis to kill them all. The apartment where this is to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages. Many poems and plays, and two operas (Les Abencérages, by Luigi Cherubini, and Lesule di Granata, by Giacomo Meyerbeer)  mention the legend, but the whole story is doubtful, because the best historians do not mention it.  –Part 17 of Washington Irvings Tales of the Alhambra*</body></html>
