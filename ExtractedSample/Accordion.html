A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist.It is played by compressing or expanding the bellows whilst pressing buttons or Musical keyboard|keys, causing valves, called pallets, to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called reed (instrument)|reeds, that vibrate to produce sound inside the body. For the accordions place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorskis   Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigotts The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones The instrument is sometimes considered a one-man-band as it needs no accompanying instrument. The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual (music)|manual, and the accompaniment, consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual. Some popular music acts also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is sometimes used in both solo and orchestra performances of classical music. patented by Cyrill Demian, which concerned "automatically coupled chords on the bass side".   being played.]]Accordions are made in a large number of different configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another: pitches depending on the direction of bellows movement* Others are unisonoric and produce the same pitch regardless of the direction of bellows movement* Some accordions use a chromatic buttonboard for the right-hand manual* Others use a diatonic buttonboard for the right-hand manual* Yet others use a piano-style musical keyboard for the right-hand manual registers different from others organ technician voice a particular instrument== Bellows  reeds and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume. expressive and does not affect Dynamics (music)|dynamics: all expression is effected through the bellows: some bellows effects as illustrated below:# Bellows used for volume control/fade# Repeated change of direction ("bellows shake")# Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals# Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance# Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving, which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions particularly for this instrument Body The accordions body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals, respectively. Each side has grilles in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to better project. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment, however skilled players can reverse these roles. Guido Deiro claimed to be the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: Sharpshooters March (1908) Guido Deiro, Guido Deiros Own Story of Sharpshooters March, The Pietro Musicordion, Volume 6, Number 2 (May–June 1948) The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as  to have only one or two rows of basses and a single octave on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models. Pallet mechanism The accordion is an aerophone. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it: Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both Det levende bælgspil (p. 9) by Jeanette &amp; Lars Dyremose (2003), and Harmonikaens historie (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)  ==There is a wide range of instruments that are called accordion. The different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in Conjunto and Tejano music. Right-hand manual systems   piano accordion]] button layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a piano-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits Dan Lindgren, Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion  wayback machine Online PDF  by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different "type":* Chromatic button accordions and the bayan (accordion)|bayan, a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged chromatically. Two of these systems exist* Diatonic button accordions use a buttonboard limited to the notes of diatonic scales in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key scale available* Piano accordions use a musical keyboard similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows* 6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6-accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row. So there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions. Left-hand manual systems  Different systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories: chords* Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has 3 rows of basses, 3 rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers 1 and 5, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of native Belgium* Various free-bass systems for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming ones own chords. These are often chosen for playing classical music Reed ranks and switches    with closeup of reeds]]Inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ranks, which can be further combined into registers producing differing timbres. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed ranks will be brought into operation, organized from high to low register (music)|registers. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See the accordion reed ranks &amp; switches article for further explanation and audio samples.All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches. Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions In describing/pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (3 octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a cassotto or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as Reeds: 5 + 3, meaning 5 reeds on the treble side and 3 on the bass, and Registers: 13 + M, 7, meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special "master" which activates ALL ranks like the "tutti" on an organ, and 7 register switches on the bass side. Straps The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller squeezeboxes, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.Other accordions, such as the diatonic button accordion, have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the players hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.== Various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities — only a few have remained in use: Viennese chamber music and klezmer, which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion Swiss organ, which usually has a 3-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement – actually a subset of the Stradella system – that travel parallel to the bellows motion*The trikitixa of the Basque people has a 2-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass Sir Jimmy Shand    sheng and khaen. The sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today. The accordions basic form is believed to have been invented in Berlin in 1822 by Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann, There is not a single document to back up this belief, Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann was 16 years old at that time and we do have some handwriting of C.F. Buschschmann and his Father, but without any related notice within. First time of mentioned a aeoline was in a writing dated 1829.   although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier.  This is the accordion owned by Fredrik Dillner of Sweden which has the name F. Löhner Nürnberg engraved (stamped) on it. The instrument was given to Johannes Dillner in 1830 or earlier    The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called accordion was first patented in 1829 by Cyrill Demian, of Armenian descent, in Vienna A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at   (Version of 20 Okt 04 - 19 Jun 09 Using Way Back Machine to Display:The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.) Demians instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a bisonoric action).The piano accordion was first played in German-speaking regions, and then spread over Europe. Some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821, but it started to actually be played much later, and built its reputation from there. treble sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages. German Text: "Mit den Dekel des Balges, läßt sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so daß man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne Töne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, muß ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, würde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird."Translation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard has to be added, the bellows will be in between this two parts, every hand will be used to push buttons and push and pull the bellow at the same time or alternatively. Trough such a doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new will be invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts will be increased and the Instrument will be heavier and more expensive.  By 1831 at least the accordion had appeared in Britain.  The instrument was noted in The Times of that year as one new to British audiences  and not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.  It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s at the latest.  The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book, Schule für Accordion. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.Jeunes flutina resembles Wheatstones concertina in internal construction and tone color, but it appears to complement Demians accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.Further innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or ethnic music, popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.  Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock, pop-rock, etc.,  and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.== Invented in 1829, its popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was spread by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians  and has been integrated into  . ==  The accordion appeared in  , and the two brothers Count Guido Deiro and Pietro Deiro were major influences at this time.Most Vaudeville theaters closed during the Great Depression, but accordionists during 1930s-1950s taught and performed for radio. During the 1950s through the 1980s the accordion received great exposure on television with performances by Myron Floren on the Lawrence Welk Show.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accordion declined in popularity. In popular music, it is now generally considered exotic or old-fashioned to include the accordion, especially in music for advertisements. Some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds.== Although best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is  , written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of Paris. Other composers, including the Russian Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, the Italian Umberto Giordano, and the American Charles Ives (1915), wrote works for the diatonic button accordion. chromatic accordion was Paul Hindemith.  In 1922, the Austrian Alban Berg included an accordion in Wozzeck, Op. 7. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century  American composer William P. Perry featured the accordion in his orchestral suite Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie (2008). The experimental composer Howard Skempton began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. Russian Bayan virtuoso Stas Venglevski has premiered contemporary works by Yehuda Yannay, Anthony Galla-Rini and William Susman. ==The accordion is a traditional instrument in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the dominant instrument used in sevdalinka, a traditional genre of folk music from Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.==The accordion is a traditional instrument in Brazil. Used in the style known as baião (music)|baião and forró in the northeast,in traditional music in the south of the country, a famous accordeonist is Renatto Borghetti, and used in sertanejo and caipira music in the south-east and mid-west regions of Brazil. Luiz Gonzaga is known as the king of baião, Mario Zan is the king of the accordion. Another famous player is Dominguinhos.==The accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia. Used in the style known as vallenato and cumbia in the Atlantic Coast of Colombia. Recently the Accordion has been used by Tropipop musicians such as Bacilos, Carlos Vives, and Andres Cabas, as well as Rock musicians like Juanes and Shakira. Vallenato has come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia. The legend of the Accordions arrival in Colombia comes from a story of a ship wreck that was coming from Germany to Argentina. The wreck happened over the Magdalena river in the Atlantic coasts.== heavy metal make their most extensive appearances in the folk metal sub-genre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances. classical and Helvetic accordion known as a zugerörgeli, which could be a distant relative (in one way or another) to the Swiss schwyzerörgeli, as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of Switzerland. The best accordions are always fully hand-made, especially in the aspect of reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a far better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured reeds. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,  a Japanese-born craftsman.The manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging. Famous centres of production are the Italian cities of Stradella and Castelfidardo, with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. Larger scale production existed in Germany by Hohner and Weltmeister, but these lost volume by the end of the 20th century. {| style="width:90%;"|- valign=top| style="width:33%;"| | style="width:33%;"| | style="width:33%;"||}     *  GoldAccordion.com* *List of accordionists*Accordion museum in Castelfidardo   Comune di Castelfidardo*  provides useful information about accordions from accordion playing to repairing and even gifts.</body></html>
