One molecule of ATP contains three phosphate groups, and it is produced by ATP synthase from inorganic phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Metabolic processes that use ATP as an energy source convert it back into its precursors. ATP is therefore continuously recycled in organisms: the human body, which on average contains only   of ATP,  turns over its own body weight in ATP each day.  substrate in phosphorylate proteins cyclic AMP. The ratio between ATP and AMP is used as a way for a cell to sense how much energy is available and control the metabolic pathways that produce and consume ATP.  Apart from its roles in energy metabolism and signaling, ATP is also incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription (genetics)|transcription. ADP and AMP. When ATP is used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar is first converted to deoxyribose by ribonucleotide reductase. Alexander Todd in 1948.  hydrolysed at extreme pH. Consequently, ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt.   unbuffered water, ADP and phosphate. This is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP are less than the strength of the hydrogen bonds (hydration bonds), between its products (ADP + phosphate), and water. Thus, if ATP and ADP are in chemical equilibrium in water, almost all of the ATP will eventually be converted to ADP. A system that is far from equilibrium contains Gibbs free energy, and is capable of doing work (thermodynamics)|work. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations a thousandfold higher than the concentration of ADP. This displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of ATP in the cell releases a large amount of free energy.       Two high-energy phosphate bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds) (those that connect adjacent phosphates) in an ATP molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule.    In the context of biochemical reactions, these anhydride bonds are frequently—and sometimes controversially—referred to as high-energy bonds.  Energy stored in ATP may be released upon hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds.  The bonds formed after hydrolysis—or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP—are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP. During enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP or phosphorylation by ATP, the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work.  Any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy, if the cell maintained their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction.  However, as is the case with most polymeric biomolecules, the breakdown of RNA, DNA, and ATP into simpler monomers is driven by both energy-release and entropy-increase considerations, in both standard concentrations, and also those concentrations encountered within the cell. standard temperature free energy of 3.4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.  The energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (P i ) or pyrophosphate (PP i ) unit from ATP at standard state of 1&amp;nbsp;M are: :ATP + H 2 O → ADP + P i    ΔG˚ = −30.5&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol (−7.3&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol):ATP + H 2 O → AMP + PP i    ΔG˚ = −45.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol (−10.9&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol)These values can be used to calculate the change in energy under physiological conditions and the cellular ATP/ADP ratio. However, a more representative value (which takes AMP into consideration) called the Energy charge is increasingly being employed. The values given for the Gibbs free energy for this reaction are dependent on a number of factors, including overall ionic strength and the presence of alkaline earth metal ions such as Mg 2+  and Ca 2+ . Under typical cellular conditions, ΔG is approximately −57&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol (−14&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol). == chelate metals Mg 2+ Na + Ca 2+ K + Sr 2+ Li +  (25).  Due to the strength of these interactions, ATP exists in the cell mostly in a complex with Mg 2+ .  The ATP concentration inside the cell is typically 1–10 molarity|mM.   hydrolysed into simple sugars, such as glucose and fructose. Fats (triglycerides) are metabolised to give fatty acids and glycerol. eukaryotic organisms are glycolysis and the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, both components of cellular respiration; and beta-oxidation. The majority of this ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote takes place in the mitochondria, which can make up nearly 25% of the total volume of a typical cell.   == In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to   and pyruvate kinase. Two molecules of NADH are also produced, which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.   ==  FADH 2 aerobic process because O 2  is needed to recycle the reduced NADH and FADH 2  to their oxidized states. In the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available NAD +  and FAD. The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD + . Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrions interior store of NAD + . A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.  In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH 2  through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This creates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient — that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix — provides the driving force for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. This enzyme contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during ATP synthesis.  ADP in the intermembrane space.    This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.== Fatty acids can also be broken down to acetyl-CoA by beta-oxidation. Each round of this cycle reduces the length of the acyl chain by two carbon atoms and produces one NADH and one FADH 2  molecule, which are used to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Because NADH and FADH 2  are energy-rich molecules, dozens of ATP molecules can be generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain. The high energy yield of this process and the compact storage of fat explain why it is the most dense source of dietary calories. ==  fermentation entails O 2  as an electron acceptor. In most eukaryotes, glucose is used as both an energy store and an electron donor. The equation for the oxidation of glucose to lactic acid is:: C 6 H 12 O 6  \to  2CH 3 CH(OH)COOH + 2 ATPIn prokaryotes, multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration. These include nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide. These processes lead to the ecologically-important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction and acetogenesis, respectively.  ==ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called "replenishment" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of   family,==In plants, ATP is synthesized in thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in a process called photophosphorylation. Here, light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane. This produces a proton-motive force and this drives the ATP synthase, exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation.  Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars.== ADP by ADP remains fairly constant.The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150&amp;nbsp;moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;kg. A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day.    This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 1000 to 1500 times during a single day (100 / 0.1 = 1000). ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis.ATP production in an aerobic eukaryotic cell is tightly regulated by allosteric mechanisms, by feedback effects, and by the substrate concentration dependence of individual enzymes within the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions. tetramer that exists in two possible conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP - the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.  A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose 1,6 and 2,6 biphosphate. The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD +  to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, adenosine diphosphate|ADP, and AMP. Citrate - the molecule that gives its name to the cycle - is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase, which is regulated by the availability of its substrate—the reduced form of cytochrome c. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:: \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{NADH} + \mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}} + \mathrm{ADP} + P_i \iff \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{NAD^{+}} + \mathrm{cyt~c_{red}} + \mathrm{ATP} which directly implies this equation:: \frac{\mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}}{\mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}} = \left(\frac{ }{ ^{+}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{   }{ }\right)K_{eq} Thus, a high ratio of   to   or a low ratio of     to   imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity.  An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. == metabolic reactions. DNA and RNA (see transport of macromolecules across cell membranes, e.g. exocytosis and endocytosis.== shortening of locomotion and Respiratory system|respiration.==Extracellular signallingATP is also a signalling molecule. ATP, ADP, or adenosine are recognised by purinergic receptors. Purinoreceptors might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues (Abbracchio M.P. et al., 2008). G protein-coupled P2X ionotropic ADP &gt; ADP &gt; ATP). P1 receptors have A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 subtypes ("A" as a remnant of old nomenclature of adenosine receptor), all of which are G protein-coupled receptors, A1 and A3 being coupled to Gi, and A2a and A2b being coupled to Gs.  All adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or  synergistic to the actions of ATP. In the CNS, adenosine has multiple functions, such as modulation of neural development, neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems (Abbracchio M.P. et al., 2008).Intracellular signallingATP is critical in signal transduction processes. It is used by kinases as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions. Kinase activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction. Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate this cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. ATP is also used by adenylate cyclase and is transformed to the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores.  This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes. == radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bonds in the course of the reaction.  RNR enzymes are recycled by reaction with thioredoxin or glutaredoxin.  DNA synthesis and DNA repair and is lethal to the cell, while an abnormal ratio of dNTPs is mutagenic due to the increased likelihood of the DNA polymerase incorporating the wrong dNTP during DNA synthesis.  Regulation of or differential specificity of RNR has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dNTP pools under cellular stress such as Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia.  In the synthesis of the nucleic acid RNA, ATP is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by RNA polymerases. The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate (two phosphate groups).  The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis, except that ATP is reduced to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP, before incorporation into DNA.  of a decarboxylase enzyme from the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis (PDB ID 1G5Q) with a bound flavin mononucleotide cofactor.]] protein fold known as the Rossmann fold, which is a general nucleotide-binding structural domain that can also bind the coenzyme Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD.  The most common ATP-binding proteins, known as kinases, share a small number of common folds; the protein kinases, the largest kinase superfamily, all share common structural features specialized for ATP binding and phosphate transfer.  ATP in complexes with proteins, in general, requires the presence of a divalent cation, almost always magnesium, which binds to the ATP phosphate groups. The presence of magnesium greatly decreases the dissociation constant of ATP from its protein binding partner without affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the ATP has bound.    The presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation.   Biochemistry laboratories often use in vitro studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this molecule is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.
