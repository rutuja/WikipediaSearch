AbraxasGnostic Basilides, 7 classic planetsâ€”Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  Holy Book antique gemstones, Xi in the Latin transliteration. The word may be related to Abracadabra, although other explanations exist. There are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about Basilides teaching, ancient Gnostic texts, the larger Greco-Roman magical traditions, and modern magical and esoteric writings. Opinions abound on Abraxas, who in recent centuries has been claimed to be both an Egyptian god and a demon.  The Swiss Psychologist Carl Jung wrote a short Gnostic treatise in 1916 called The Seven Sermons to the Dead, which called Abraxas a God higher than the Christian God and Devil, that combines all opposites into one Being. Basilidian system, as our authorities often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of Basilides himself.== In the system described by Irenaeus, "the Unbegotten Father" is the progenitor of Nous, and from Nous Logos, from Logos Phronesis, from Phronesis Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia and Dynamis, from Sophia and Dynamis principalities, powers, and angels, the last of whom create "the first heaven." They in turn originate a second series, who create a second heaven. The process continues in like manner until 365 heavens are in existence, the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world. "The ruler"   of the 365 heavens "is Abraxas, and for this reason he contains within himself 365 numbers."  Refutation of all Heresies (vii. 26) by Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus, who appears in these chapters to have followed the Exegetica of Basilides. After describing the manifestation of the Gospel in the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, he adds that the Basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several stages of the upper world (diastemata), in which they speak of 365 heavens and say that "their great archon" is Abrasax, because his name contains the number 365, the number of the days in the year; i.e. the sum of the numbers denoted by the Greek letters in Î‘Î’Î¡Î‘Î£Î‘Îž according to the rules of isopsephy is 365::Î‘ = 1, Î’ = 2, Î¡ = 100, Î‘ = 1, Î£ = 200, Î‘ = 1,  Îž = 60== Epiphanius (Panarion|Haer. 69, 73 f.) appears to follow partly Irenaeus, partly the lost Compendium of Hippolytus.  He designates Abrasax more distinctly as "the power above all, and First Principle," "the cause and first archetype" of all things; and mentions that the Basilidians referred to 365 as the number of parts (mele) in the human body, as well as of days in the year. The author of the appendix to Tertullian De Praescr. Haer. (c. 4), who likewise follows Hippolytuss Compendium,  adds some further particulars; that Abraxas gave birth to Mind (nous), the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by Irenaeus and Epiphanius; that the world, as well as the 365 heavens, was created in honour of Abraxas; and that Christ was sent not by the Maker of the world but by Abraxas.Nothing can be built on the vague allusions of Jerome, according to whom Abraxas meant for Basilides "the greatest God" (De vir. ill. 21), "the highest God" (Dial. adv. Lucif. 23), "the Almighty God" (Comm. in Amos iii. 9), and "the Lord the Creator" (Comm. in Nah. i. 11). The notices in Theodoret (Haer. fab. i. 4), Augustine (Haer. 4), and Praedestinatus (i. 3), have no independent value.It is evident from these particulars that Abrasax was the name of the first of the 365 Archons, and accordingly stood below Sophia and Dynamis and their progenitors; but his position is not expressly stated, so that the writer of the supplement to Tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with "the Supreme God."== Sophia and other Aeons of the Pleroma in the light of the luminary Eleleth. In several texts, the luminary Eleleth is the last of the luminaries (Spiritual Lights) that come forward, and it is the Aeon Sophia, associated with Eleleth, who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the Demiurges rule of this world, and the salvage effort that ensues.  As such, the role of Aeons of Eleleth, including Abrasax, Sophia, and others, pertains to this outer border of the Pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of Lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality.A vast number of engraved stones are in existence, to which the name "Abrasax-stones" has long been given. One particularly fine example was included as part of the Thetford treasure from fourth century Norfolk, UK. The subjects are mythological, and chiefly grotesque, with various inscriptions, in which Î‘Î’Î¡Î‘Î£Î‘Îž often occurs, alone or with other words. Sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription. In certain obscure magical writings of Egyptian origin á¼€Î²Ï�Î±Î¾Î¬Ï‚ or á¼€Î²Ï�Î±ÏƒÎ¬Î¾ is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems;  it is also found on the Greek metal tesserÃ¦ among other mystic words. The meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible: but some of the gems are amulets; and the same may be the case with nearly all.==  Kabbalists and the Primal Man whom God made in His own image." Some parts at least of the figure above mentioned are solar symbols, and the Basilidian Abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun. J. J. Bellermann has speculated that "the whole represents the Supreme Being, with his Five great Emanations, each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem. Thus, from the human body, the usual form assigned to the Deity, forasmuch as it is written that God created man in his own image, issue the two supporters, Nous and Logos, symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding, as typified by the serpents, for the same reason that had induced the old Greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to Pallas. His headâ€”a cocksâ€”represents Phronesis, the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance. His two hands bear the badges of Sophia and Dynamis, the shield of Wisdom, and the scourge of Power." ==These Abrasax-stones often bear Hebraic names of God: Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Elohim|Eloai. The name Î™Î‘Î©, to which Î£Î‘Î’Î‘Î©Î˜ is sometimes added, is found with this figure even more frequently than Î‘Î’Î¡Î‘Î£Î‘Îž, and they are often combined. Beside an Abrasax figure the following, for instance, is found: IAÎ© ABPAÎ£AÎž AÎ”Î©N Î‘Î¤Î‘, "Iao Abrasax, thou art the Lord".  With the Abrasax-shield are also found the divine names Sabaoth Iao, Iao Abrasax, Adonai Abrasax, etc. ==The   and Ya. The Leyden papyrus recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon: The magic word "Ablanathanalba," which reads in Greek the same backward as forward, also occurs in the Abrasax-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning "Thou art our father" (×�×‘ ×œ×Ÿ ×�×ª), and also occurs in connection with Abrasax; the following inscription is found upon a metal plate in the Carlsruhe Museum: Ð�Ð’Ð Ð�Î£Ð�Îž Î‘Î’Î›Î‘Î�Î‘Î˜ Î‘Î�Î‘Î›Î’Î‘ ==In the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as Basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin, and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of Gnostics. During the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems which had no claim to be considered in any sense Gnostic, or specially Basilidian, or connected with Abrasax. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes:* Abrasax, or stones of Basilidian origin* Abrasaxtes, or stones originating in ancient forms of worship, and adapted by the Gnostics* AbraxoÃ¯des, or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of BasilidesWhile it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of Gnostics, there is no valid reason for attributing any or all of them to such an origin. The fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what Irenaeus says about the followers of Basilides:   Incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid Gnosticism planted in Spain and southern Gaul at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth, which Jerome connects with Basilides, and which (according to his Epist., lxxv.) used the name Abrasax. Clement in the two passages in which he instructs the Christians of Alexandria on the right use of rings and gems, and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them (Paed. 241 ff.; 287 ff.). But no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of Gnostic mythology has had any success, and Abrasax is the only Gnostic term found in the accompanying legends which is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies. The present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the Basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown. Having due regard to the magic papyri, in which many of the unintelligible names of the Abrasax-stones reappear, besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic.Gaius Julius Hyginus (Fab. 183) gives Abrax Aslo Therbeeo as names of horses of the sun mentioned by Homerus. The passage is miserably corrupt: but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make Abraxas.The proper form of the name is evidently Abrasax, as with the Greek writers, Hippolytus, Epiphanias, Didymus (De Trin. iii. 42), and Theodoret; also Augustine and Praedestinatus; and in nearly all the legends on gems. By a probably euphonic inversion the translator of Irenaeus and the other Latin authors have Abraxas, which is found in the magical papyri, and even, though most sparingly, on engraved stones.The attempts to discover a derivation for the name, Greek, Hebrew, Coptic, or other, have not been entirely successful:==* Claudius Salmasius thought it Egyptian, but never gave the proofs which he promised.* Friedrich MÃ¼nter separates it into two Coptic words signifying â€œnew fangled title.â€�*J. J. Bellermann thinks it a compound of the Egyptian words abrak and sax, meaning â€œthe honorable and hallowed word,â€� or â€œthe word is adorable.â€� Samuel Sharpe finds in it an Egyptian invocation to the Godhead, meaning â€œhurt me not.â€�==* Abraham Geiger sees in it a Grecized form of ha-berakhah, â€œthe blessing,â€� a meaning which C.W. King declares philologically untenable.*J. B. Passerius derives it from abh, â€œfather,â€� bara, â€œto create,â€� and a- negativeâ€”â€œthe uncreated Father.â€�*Giuseppe Barzilai goes back for explanation to the first verse of the prayer attributed to Rabbi Nehunya ben HaKanah, the literal rendering of which is â€œO  , with thy mighty right hand deliver the unhappy  ,â€� forming from the initial and final letters of the words the word Abrakd (pronounced Abrakad), with the meaning â€œthe host of the winged ones,â€� i.e., angels. But this extremely ingenious theory would at most explain only the mystic word Abracadabra, whose connection with Abrasax is by no means certain.==* Wendelin discovers a compound of the initial letters, amounting to 365 in numerical value, of four Hebrew and three Greek words, all written with Greek characters: ab, ben, rouach, hakadÅ�s; sÅ�tÄ“ria apo xylou (â€œFather, Son, Spirit, holy; salvation from the crossâ€�).*According to a note of Isaac de Beausobreâ€™s, Jean Hardouin accepted the first three of these, taking the four others for the initials of the Greek anthrÅ�poussÅ�zÅ�n hagiÅ�i xylÅ�i, â€œsaving mankind by the holy cross.â€�* Isaac de Beausobre derives Abrasax from the Greek habros and saÅ�, â€œthe beautiful, the glorious Savior.â€�Perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by Adolf von Harnack,  â€œwhich belong to no known speech, and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect, or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration.â€�  De Mysteriis Porphyry (vii. 4) admits a preference of barbarous to vernacular names in sacred things, urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations, as the Egyptians and Assyrian people|Assyrians; and Origen (Contra Cels. i. 24) refers to the potent names used by Egyptian sages, Persian Magi, and Indian Brahmins, signifying deities in the several languages.; Thomas More,  Utopia In the 1516 novel Utopia (book)|Utopia by Thomas More, the island called Utopia once had the name "Abraxa", which scholars have suggested is a related use. ; Aleister Crowley, "The Gnostic Mass"Abrasax is invoked in Aleister Crowleys 1913 work, "The Gnostic Mass" of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica: ;Carl Jung, Seven Sermons to the Dead Abraxas is an important figure in Carl Jungs 1916 book Seven Sermons to the Dead, a representation of the driving force of individuation (synthesis, maturity, oneness), referred with the figures for the driving forces of differentiation (emergence of consciousness and opposites), Helios God-the-Sun, and the Devil.
