ABBA Swedish Pop pop group most commercially successful acts in the history of pop music, topping the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982. New Zealand, South Africa collection of their hit songs in Spanish.During the bands active years, FÃ¤ltskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and Anderssonâ€“although both couples later divorced. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus-FÃ¤ltskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson-Lyngstad marriage in 1981. As a result, these relationship changes began appearing in the groups music, as they produced more introspective lyrics with different compositions. A film of the same name released in 2008 became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 2010. ==Benny Andersson (born 16 December 1946 in Stockholm, Sweden) became (at age 18) the member of a popular Swedish pop-rock group, The Hep Stars, that performed covers of international hits. The Hep Stars were known as "The Swedish Beatles". They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of the Apple Corps. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original compositions for his band, many of which became major hits including "No Response" that hit number 3 in 1965, "Sunny Girl", "Wedding" and "Consolation", all of which hit number 1 in 1966.  Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with Lasse Berghagen, with whom he composed his first Svensktoppen entry "Sagan om lilla Sofi" ("The Story of Little Sophie") in 1968.BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus (born 25 April 1945 in Gothenburg, Sweden) also began his musical career at 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted The Hootenanny Singers, a popular Swedish folk music|folk-skiffle group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and The Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was "Isnt It Easy to Say", a song later recorded by The Hep Stars. Stig Anderson was the manager of The Hootenanny Singers and founder of the Polar Music label. He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to compose more. Both also began playing occasionally with the others bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: "Ljuva sextital" ("Merry Sixties"), recorded by Brita Borg, and The Hep Stars 1969 hit "Speleman" ("Fiddler").Andersson wrote and submitted the song "Hej, Clown" for the 1969 Melodifestivalen, the Swedish Eurovision Song Contest. The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Anderssons song to second place.  On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer Frida Lyngstad|Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called Lycka ("Happiness"), which included original compositions sung by both men. Their spouses were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; FÃ¤ltskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with The Hootenanny Singers until the summer of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records. covers of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish folkparks. In 1967, she submitted an original song, "FÃ¶rsonade" ("Redeemed") for Melodifestivalen, but it was rejected. She briefly met Anni-Frid Lyngstad for the first time during a TV show in January 1968, and met Ulvaeus at a concert venue a few months later.During filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, FÃ¤ltskog met Ulvaeus again, and they were married in 1971. FÃ¤ltskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each others recording sessions,  and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to her third studio album Som jag Ã¤r (As I Am) (1970). In 1972, FÃ¤ltskog starred as Mary Magdalene in the original Swedish production of Jesus Christ Superstar and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, FÃ¤ltskog released five studio albums. Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid "Frida" Lyngstad (born 15 November 1945 in BjÃ¸rkÃ¥sen in Ballangen, Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the summer of 1967, she won a national talent competition with the song "En ledig dag" ("A Day Off"), which is included in the EMI compilation Frida 1967-1972. The first prize was a recording contract with EMI Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3Â½ hour documentary Frida - The DVD. Lyngstad released several singles on EMI and had many hits in the Swedish charts. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number 1 single, "Min egen stad" ("My Own Town"), for which all the future ABBA members sang the backup vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and FÃ¤ltskog during a TV show in early 1968.Lyngstad finally linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestivalen, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single "Peter Pan" in September 1969 â€“ her first collaboration with Benny & BjÃ¶rn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstads debut studio album, Frida (album)|Frida, which was released in March 1971 and praised by critics. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, Frida ensam, which included the original Swedish rendition of "Fernando (song)|Fernando", a hit in Scandinavia before the English version was recorded. First live performance and the start of "Festfolk"An attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, Lycka, which was to be released in September 1970. FÃ¤ltskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of them working together saw them launch a stage act, "Festfolk" (which translates from Swedish to mean both "Party People" and "Engaged Couples") on 1 November 1970 in Gothenburg. The cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit "Hej, gamle man" ("Hello, Old Man"); the first BjÃ¶rn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.First record together "Hej, gamle man""Hej, gamle man", a song about an old Salvation Army soldier, became the quartets first hit. The record was credited to BjÃ¶rn & Benny and reached number 5 on the sales charts and number 1 on Svensktoppen, staying there for 15 weeks.During 1971, the four artists began working together more, adding vocals to the others recordings. FÃ¤ltskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own. Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer. ==After the 1970 release of Lycka, two more singles credited to BjÃ¶rn & Benny were released in Sweden, "Det kan ingen doktor hjÃ¤lpa" ("No Doctor Can Help with That") and "TÃ¤nk om jorden vore ung" ("Imagine If the Earth Were Young"), with more prominent vocals by FÃ¤ltskog and Lyngstadâ€“and moderate chart success.FÃ¤ltskog and Ulvaeus were married on 6 July 1971. They and Andersson started performing together on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks during the summer of that year.Stig Anderson, founder and owner of Polar Music, was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. "One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit", he predicted.  Stig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971,  Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song "SÃ¤g det med en sÃ¥ng" ("Say It with a Song") for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform. The song came in third place, encouraging Stig Anderson, and became a hit in Sweden.  Koichi Morita). First hit as BjÃ¶rn, Benny, Agnetha & Anni-FridUlvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements. "People Need Love" was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence. Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited to BjÃ¶rn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid. The song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something.  The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number 114 on the Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox singles chart and number 117 on theRecord World singles chart. Labeled as BjÃ¶rn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka), it was released there through Playboy Records. However, according to Stig Anderson, "People Need Love" could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers. The foursome decided to record their first album together in the autumn of 1972, and sessions began on 26 September 1972. The women shared lead vocals on "Nina, Pretty Ballerina" that day, and their voices in harmony for the first time gave the foursome an idea of the quality of their combined talents."Ring Ring" Ring Ring". Ring Ring. The album did well and the "Ring Ring" single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa. However, Stig Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit. Official namingIn early 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA. At first, this was a play on words, as  .The first time "ABBA" is found written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in Stockholm, dated 16 October 1973. This was first written as "BjÃ¶rn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida", but was subsequently crossed out with "ABBA" written in large letters on top.The official logo, using the bold version of the News Gothic typeface, was designed by Rune SÃ¶derqvist, and appeared for the first time on the "Dancing Queen" single in August 1976, and subsequently on all later original albums and singles. But the idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang Heilemann on a "Dancing Queen" shoot for the teenage magazine Bravo (magazine)|Bravo. On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that one of the men held his letter backwards. They discussed it and the members of ABBA liked it. Following their acquisition of the groups catalogue, Polygram began using variations of the ABBA logo, using a different font and adding a crown emblem to it in 1992 for the first release of the ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits compilation. When Universal Music purchased Polygram (and, thus, ABBAs label Polar Music International), control of the groups catalogue was returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products. ==Eurovision Ring Ring" but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry, Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest.Ulvaeus, Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using Melodifestivalen and Eurovision TV contests as a way to make the music business aware of them as composers, as well as the band itself. In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest and from a number of newly written compositions, the upbeat song "Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo" was chosen; the group was now inspired by the growing glam rock scene in England. "Waterloo" was an unashamedly glam-style pop track produced with Michael B. Tretows wall-of-sound approach. ABBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the international contest. Winning the Eurovision Song Contest on 6 April 1974 gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows; thus the band saw the "Waterloo" single chart in many European countries. "Waterloo" was ABBAs first number one single in big markets such as the UK and Germany. In the United States, the song peaked at number six on the   called it "a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively . . . an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project", while Creem characterized it as "a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions".ABBAs follow-up single, "Honey, Honey", peaked at number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and was a number 2 hit in Germany. However, in the United Kingdom, ABBAs British record label, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of "Ring Ring" instead of "Honey, Honey", and a cover version of the latter by the act Sweet Dreams reached number 10. Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other. "Ring Ring" failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, increasing growing speculation that the group were simply Eurovision one-hit wonders.Post-EurovisionIn November 1974, ABBA embarked on their first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany and Austria. It was not as successful as the band had hoped, since most of the venues did not sell out. Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland. The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was very different. They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for. Live performances continued during the summer of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a sixteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland. Their Stockholm show at the GrÃ¶na Lund amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200.  Mamma Mia" BMI Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975.The success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases. By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack. The eponymous ABBA  album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at number 165 on the Cashbox album chart and number 174 on the Billboard 200 chart. Opinions were voiced, by Creem in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured "a very sloppy promotional campaign". Nevertheless, the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press. Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox went as far as saying that "there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abbas marketing, creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts", while Creem wrote: "SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles".In Australia, the airing of the music videos for "I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do" and "Mamma Mia" on nationwide television in August 1975 started an immense interest for ABBA, resulting in number 1 positions on both the single and album charts for months.== Greatest Hits, Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, ABBAs first American number one single. BRIT Award in the category "Best International Album of the Year". By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In Frida â€“ The DVD, Lyngstad explains how she and FÃ¤ltskog developed as singers, as ABBAs recordings grew more complex over the years.The bands popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and "Dancing Queen" became the only Billboard Hot 100 number 1 single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number 1 position on other Billboard charts, including Billboard Adult Contemporary and Hot Dance Club Play). Nevertheless, Arrival finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA.European and Australian tourIn January 1977, ABBA embarked on the first major tour. The groups status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. They opened their much anticipated tour in  , though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed.  at the opening concert of ABBAs European and Australian Tour in Oslo, 28 January 1977.]]After the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played eleven dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the  , directed by Lasse HallstrÃ¶m.The Australian tour and its subsequent ABBA: The Movie produced some ABBA lore, as well. FÃ¤ltskogs blonde good looks had long made her the bands "pin-up girl", a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline "Agnethas bottom tops dull show". When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: "Dont they have bottoms in Australia?" In December 1977, ABBA followed up Arrival with the more ambitious fifth album  , released to coincide with the debut of ABBA: The Movie. Although the album was less well-received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: "The Name of the Game" and "Take a Chance on Me", which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number 3 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US. Although "Take a Chance on Me" did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBAs biggest hit single there, selling more copies than "Dancing Queen".  The Album also included the signature song, "Thank You for the Music", the B-side of "Eagle (song)|Eagle" in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and was later released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983.Polar Music Studio formation By 1978, ABBA was one of the biggest bands in the world. They converted a vacant movie theatre into the Polar Music Studio, a state-of-the-art studio in Stockholm. The studio was used by several other bands; notably, Genesis (band)|Genesis Duke (album)|Duke and Led Zeppelins In Through the Out Door were recorded there. During May, the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign, performing alongside Andy Gibb on Olivia Newton-Johns TV show. Recording sessions for the single "Summer Night City" were an uphill struggle, but upon release the song became another hit for the group. The track would set the stage for ABBAs foray into disco with their next album. On 9 January 1979, the group performed "Chiquitita" at the Music for UNICEF Concert held at the United Nations General Assembly to celebrate UNICEFs Year of the Child. ABBA donated the copyright of this worldwide hit to the United Nations Childrens Fund|UNICEF; see Music for UNICEF Concert.  The single was released the following week, and reached number 1 in ten countries.North American and European toursIn mid-January 1979, Ulvaeus and FÃ¤ltskog announced they were getting divorced. The news caused interest from the media, and led to speculation about the bands future. ABBA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group, and that the divorce would not affect them.  Nonetheless, the media continued to confront them with this in interviews. To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Andersson and Ulvaeus secretly travelled to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, where for two weeks they prepared their next albums songs in relative quiet.The groups sixth studio album,  ", another number 3 hit in both the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, the group were paid in oil commodities because of an embargo on the Soviet ruble|ruble.  Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Canada, with a full house of 14,000. "The voices of the band, Agnethas high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning", raved Edmonton Journal. extreme weather Boston Music Hall for the performance 90 minutes late. The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at Maple Leaf Gardens before a capacity crowd of 18,000. "ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, theyre also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone whos been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied", wrote Record World.On 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at Londons Wembley Arena.Progression , seventh studio album released by the group in 1980]] Super Trouper, Super Trouper", also hit number 1 in the UK, becoming the groups ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from the Super Trouper album, "Lay All Your Love on Me", released in 1981 as a 12-inch single only in selected territories, managed to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number 7 on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting 12-inch release in UK chart history. Gracias Por La MÃºsica. This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of "Chiquitita", this signalled the groups breakthrough in Latin America. ABBA Oro: Grandes Ã‰xitos, the Spanish equivalent of ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits, was released in 1999.==In January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena KÃ¤llersjÃ¶, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party. For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track "Hovas Vittne" (a pun on the Swedish name for Jehovahs Witness and Andersons birthplace, Hova, Sweden|Hova) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectible. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona NÃ¶rklit, whom he married in November 1981. The Visitors, One of Us", proved to be the last of ABBAs nine number 1 singles in Germany in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. "One of Us" was also ABBAs final Top 10 hit in the UK. When All Is Said and Done", was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBAs final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number 4 on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The songs lyrics, as with "The Winner Takes It All" and "One of Us", dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstads divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of The Visitors, which hit the Top Ten on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.Last recording sessionsIn the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: "You Owe Me One", "I Am the City" and "Just Like That". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer. Back in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named  . New songwriting and recording sessions took place,  and during October and November, they released the singles "The Day Before You Came"/"Cassandra" and "Under Attack"/"You Owe Me One", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though "The Day Before You Came" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to number 1 in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. "Under Attack", the groups final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium."I Am the City" and "Just Like That" were left unreleased on The Singles: The First Ten Years for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. "I Am the City" was eventually released on the compilation album   in 1993, while "Just Like That" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical Chess (musical)|Chess.  The chorus section of "Just Like That" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994. Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBAs version of "Just Like That" in its entirety, even though the complete version surfaced on bootlegs.The group travelled to London to promote The Singles: The First Ten Years in the first week of November 1982, appearing on Saturday Superstore and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme NÃ¶jesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on Noel Edmonds The Late, Late Breakfast Show, through a live link from a TV studio in Stockholm.Last performances Alain and Les MisÃ©rables, had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast.

"Abbacadabra" premiÃ¨red on 8 December 1983 at The Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording "Belle" in English as "Time", a duet with actor and singer B. A. Robertson: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus.All four members made their last public appearance, as four friends more than as ABBA, in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of "Tivedshambo", which was the first song written by their manager, Stig Anderson, for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friends 40th birthday: their old tour manager, Claes af Geijerstam. They sang a self-composed song titled "Der Kleine Franz" that was later to rsurface in Chess. Also in 1986, ABBA Live was released, featuring selections of live performances from the groups 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests on the 50th birthday of GÃ¶rel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring GÃ¶rel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song "Med En Enkel Tulipan" a cappella.  BAO band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs "Like an Angel Passing Through My Room" with opera singer Anne Sofie von Otter, and "When All Is Said and Done" with Swede Viktoria Tolstoy. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of "Fernando" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of "Dancing Queen" with the Swedish group The Real Group in 1993, and has also re-recorded "I Have a Dream" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.== Mamma Mia! movie on 4 July 2008.

However, on 3 January 2011, FÃ¤ltskog, who has been long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and possibly also the major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement. She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members.==Andersson and Ulvaeus  Broadway in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged Chess pÃ¥ svenska (Chess in Swedish) in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers "Han Ã¤r en man, han Ã¤r ett barn" ("Hes a Man, Hes a Child") and "GlÃ¶m mig om du kan" ("Forget Me If You Can"). In 2008, the musical was again revived for a successful staging at Londons Royal Albert Hall which was subsequently released on DVD, and then in two successful separate touring productions in the United States and United Kingdom, in 2010.Andersson and Ulvaeus next project, Kristina frÃ¥n DuvemÃ¥la, an epic Swedish musical, premiered in MalmÃ¶, in southern Sweden in October 1995. The musical ran for five years in Stockholm, and an English version has been in development for some considerable time. It has been reported that a Broadway production is in its earliest stages of pre-production.  In the meantime, following some earlier workshops, a full presentation of the English translation of the musical in concert, now with the shortened name of "Kristina", took place to capacity crowds in September 2009 at New Yorks Carnegie Hall, and in April 2010 at Londons Royal Albert Hall, followed by a CD release of the New York recordings.  2006]] Gemini in November 1989.In the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet  , an English-language album by the groups Josefin Nilsson with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to Roy Anderssons Songs from the Second Floor). In 2001, Andersson formed his own band, Benny Anderssons Orkester (BAO), which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007 respectively. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio Svensktoppen charts; the song "Du Ã¤r min man" ("You Are My Man"), sung by Helen SjÃ¶holm, spent 278 weeks there between 2004 and 2009.  Andersson released his third album BAO 3 in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen SjÃ¶holm and Tommy KÃ¶rberg, as well as playing to full houses at two of Swedens largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000.  2007]] Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of The Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of VÃ¤stervik, singing their 1966 hit "Marianne".Andersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical Mamma Mia!, alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres.
