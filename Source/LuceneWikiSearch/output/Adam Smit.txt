Adam Smith baptised 16 social philosopher An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. It earned him an enormous reputation and would become one of the most influential works on economics ever published. Smith is widely cited as the father of modern economics and capitalism.  Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and the University of Oxford. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith then returned home and spent the next ten years writing The Wealth of Nations, publishing it in 1776. He died in 1790 at the age of 67.== John Rae recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of four and released when others went to rescue him.  Smith was close to his mother, who likely encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.    He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldyâ€”characterised by Rae as  "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"â€”from 1729 to 1737.    While there, Smith studied Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.  .|alt=A plaque of Smith]]== Francis Hutcheson.  Here, Smith developed his passion for liberty, reason, and free speech. In 1740, Smith was awarded the Snell exhibition and left to attend Balliol College, Oxford. Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow far superior to that at University of Oxford|Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.    In Book V, Chapter II of The Wealth of Nations, Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching." David Humes Treatise on Human Nature, and they subsequently  confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.        According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of   time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."  Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Oxford library.    When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.    Near the end of his time at Oxford, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.    He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.   English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and University of Cambridge|Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England.  Francis Hutcheson. Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavored not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"â€“â€“a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson. == Lord Kames. natural liberty". While Smith was not adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success.     was a friend and contemporary of Smith.|alt=A man posing for a painting]]In 1750, he met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.  head of Moral Philosophy died the next year, Smith took over the position.  He worked as an academic for the next thirteen years, which he characterized as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period  ".    moral sentiments. third Lord utility as Hume did, but on sympathy. Following the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.    After the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.  For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labor, rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.    Physiocratic school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]] Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position, and he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term, but his students refused.   ==Smiths tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects - such as proper Polish.  He was paid Pound sterling|Â£300 per year (plus expenses) along with a Â£300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.  Smith first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse|Toulouse, France, where he stayed for one and a half years.  According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time".  After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire.  Jean DAlembert, Physiocratic school. Laissez faire Louis XIV Louis XV unproductive labour. unproductive labour â€“ the physiocratic classe steril â€“ was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.==In 1766, Henry Scotts younger brother died in Paris, and Smiths tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.  Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus.  There he befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. As well as teaching Moyes, Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young mans education.  In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London,  and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775.  The Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.   In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in Panmure House in Edinburghs Canongate.  Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,  and from 1787 to 1789 he occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow.  He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness and was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard.  On his death bed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.   Smiths literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black, and the pioneering geologist James Hutton.    Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.    He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as Essays on Philosophical Subjects. Smiths library went by his will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith.  It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Rev. W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queens College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queens College. After his death the remaining books were sold.  On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879 her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church), Edinburgh.== s enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today. |alt=An enamel paste medallion, depicting a mans head facing the right]]Not much is known about Smiths personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.  He never married,  and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before his own death. Smith, who is often described as a prototypical absent-minded professor,    is considered by historians to have been an eccentric but benevolent intellectual, comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity".  He was known to talk to himself,  a habit that began during his childhood when he would speak to himself and smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.  He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,  and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.  tanning pit from which he needed help to escape.    Another episode records that he put bread and butter into a teapot, drank the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had.

The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th century reprints of The Wealth of Nations were based largely on Tassies medallion. ==There has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of Smiths religious views. Smiths father had a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland.  In addition to the fact that he received the Snell Exhibition, Smith may have also moved to England with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England. At Oxford, Smith rejected Christianity and it is generally believed that he returned to Scotland as a deist. Economist Ronald Coase has challenged the view that Smith was a deist,  stating that while Smith may have referred to the "Great Architect of the Universe" in his works, other scholars have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God".  He based this on analysis of a remark in The Wealth of Nations where Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature" such as "the generation, the life, growth and dissolution of plants and animals" has led men to "enquire into their causes".    Coase also notes Smiths observation that " uperstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods." == In 1759, Smith published his first work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. He continued making extensive revisions to the book, up until his death.  Although The Wealth of Nations is widely regarded as Smiths most influential work, it is believed that Smith himself considered The Theory of Moral Sentiments to be a superior work. In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from social relationships.  His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgements, in spite of mans natural inclinations towards self-interest. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior. Scholars have traditionally perceived a conflict between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations; the former emphasizes sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.  In recent years, however, most scholars    of Smiths work have argued that no contradiction exists.  They claim that in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathize with them. Rather than viewing The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments as presenting incompatible views of human nature, most Smith scholars regard the works as emphasizing different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. The Wealth of Nations draws on situations where mans morality is likely to play a smaller role, such as the laborer involved in pin-making, whereas The Theory of Moral Sentiments focuses on situations where mans morality is likely to play a dominant role among more personal exchanges.  Quesnay taught unproductive labour. Puffendorf and Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson,  Smiths teacher, â€“ elements compatible with a neoclassical theory â€“ changed to the macro-economical view of the classical theory Smith learned in France. ==   where Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations|alt=A brown building]]There is a fundamental dissent between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smiths most influential work: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Neoclassical economists emphasise Smiths invisible hand,  a concept mentioned in the middle of his work â€“ book IV, chapter II â€“ and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme how to promote the "Wealth of Nations" in the first sentences.Smith used the term "   (1759) and in The Wealth of Nations  (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted as "the invisible hand" in numerous ways. It is therefore important to read the original: As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other eases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.  . Those who regard that statement as Smiths central message also quote frequently Smiths dictum:  It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.  Smiths statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" is certainly meant to answer Bernard Mandeville|Mandevilles contention that "Private Vices â€¦ may be turned into Public Benefits".  It shows Smiths belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest, he indirectly promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices."  Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or Monopoly|monopolies, fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".   Smith also warned that a true laissez-faire economy would quickly become a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation.  Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "...in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public...The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."  General Equilibrium concept. Paul Samuelson|Samuelsons "Economics" refers 6 times to Smiths "invisible hand".  To emphasize this relation, Samuelson  quotes Smiths "invisible hand" statement putting "general interest" where Smith wrote "publick interest". Samuelson  concluded: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market." And it was then when neoclassical economics was revived in Chicago from oblivion and Samuelson entered the scene. physiocratical concept unproductive labour unproductive labour should be pushed back to use more labor productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labor should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labor. Deepening the division of labor means under competition lower prices and thereby extended markets. Extended markets and increased production lead to a new step of reorganising production and inventing new ways of producing which again lower prices, etc., etc.. Smiths central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". It predicted Englands evolution as the workshop of the World, underselling all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarize this policy: The annual labor of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes â€¦ .  his produce â€¦ bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it â€¦ . ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labor is generally applied; and,* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed  .  Smiths "Wealth of Nations" offers many insights other theories disagree. It argues that agriculture offers fewer possibilities to a division of labor,  raising its prices compared with industry.  . To Smith, the genius and the natural talents of men are no natural dispositions which have to be paid for according to comparative advantages. "It is not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour."  Competition should reduce the prices of these "talents". Smith suspects manufacturers of mischief and trusts landowners and labourers â€“ as consumers â€“ to represent the common good.   ==Prominent interpretation, as well as criticism, of Smiths views on the societal merits of unregulated labor management by the ruling class is expressed by Noam Chomsky as follows: "Hes pre-capitalist, a figure of the Enlightenment. What we would call capitalism he despised. People read snippets of Adam Smith, the few phrases they teach in school. Everybody reads the first paragraph of The Wealth of Nations where he talks about how wonderful the division of labor is. But not many people get to the point hundreds of pages later, where he says that division of labor will destroy human beings and turn people into creatures as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human being to be. And therefore in any civilized society the government is going to have to take some measures to prevent division of labor from proceeding to its limits." == |alt=A burial]]Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published Essays on Philosophical Subjects, a history of astronomy down to Smiths own era, plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. Lectures on Jurisprudence were notes taken from Smiths early lectures, plus an early draft of The Wealth of Nations, published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763) (first published in 1896); A Treatise on Public Opulence (1764) (first published in 1937); and Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795). ==The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirized by Tory writers in the moralizing tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.  equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment. Paul Samuelson finds in Smiths pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modeling of Walras a century later.  Smiths allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention added a realism missed later by Malthus, Ricardo, and Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence-wage theory of labour supply. On the other hand, Joseph Schumpeter dismissed Smiths contributions as unoriginal, saying "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along." Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the " , v. 3, 383.   The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labor that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern understanding of mainstream economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing. The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "  as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side. The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of The Wealth of Nations  was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for The Theory of Moral Sentiments and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His homo economicus or "economic  man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally,economists David Levy and Sandra  Peart in  "The Secret History of the Dismal Science"  point to his opposition hierarchy, beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality,  and  provide additional support for those who  point to  Smiths opposition   to slavery, colonialism, and empire.  They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article..  Emphasized also are Smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor,and the efforts to keep wages low. In The â€œVanity of the Philosopherâ€�: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics Peart and Levy also cite Smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,  and point to the need for greater appreciation of the  public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense. Smith had a critical view on property, saying "Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality â€¦ Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all."  20 note was issued by the Bank of England and features Smith.|alt=A bank note depicting a mans head facing to the right]]==  s High Street, built through private donations organised by the Adam Smith Institute.]] English banknote.   A large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a  -tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside St Giles Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross.  20th century sculptor Jim Sanborn (best known for the Kryptos sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency) has created multiple pieces which feature Smiths work. At Central Connecticut State University is Circulating Capital, a tall cylinder which features an extract from The Wealth of Nations on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text but represented in binary code.  At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is Adam Smiths Spinning Top.   Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University. ==His house on Panmure Close off the Canongate survived until 1889,  but a nearby building of similar age adopted the stance of having been his house (in the same manner as John Knoxs House) erecting a plaque c.1950 proclaiming itself as having been his residence. In reality Smiths residence was a far grander building than that remaining.==  at Cleveland State University|alt=A sculpture of an upside down cone]]Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute, Adam Smith Society    and the Australian Adam Smith Club,    and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie. Alan Greenspan argues that, while Smith did not coin the term laissez-faire, "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history".    P. J. ORourke describes Smith as the "founder of free market economics".    discriminatory taxation improper or luxurious behavior". Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in The Economic Journal that in the 20th century United States, Reaganomics supporters, The Wall Street Journal, and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of laissez-faire capitalism and supply-side economics".    In fact, The Wealth of Nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:  "The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state."    Moreover, in this passage Smith goes on to specify progressive, not flat, taxation: "The rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion"  Smith even specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent. He believed that tax laws should be as transparent as possible and that each individual should pay a "certain amount, and not arbitrary,"  in addition to paying this tax at the time "most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it".  Smith goes on to state that:  "Every tax, however, is, to the person who pays it, a badge, not of slavery, but of liberty."  Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defense and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. he supported public education and religious institutions as providing general benefit to the society. Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court  of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge."  In addition, he was in favor of retaliatory tariffs and believed that they would eventually bring down the price of goods. He even stated in Wealth of Nations:  "The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods."   s such as Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty") but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissez-faire.    Daniel Klein believes using the term "free market economics" or "free market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smiths economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity.   Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smiths thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.    Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defense.
