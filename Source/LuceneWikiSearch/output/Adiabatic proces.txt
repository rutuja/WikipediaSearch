Adiabatic processisocaloric processes; the remaining complement subset of isocaloric processes being processes where net heat transfer does not diverge regionally such as in an idealized case with mediums of infinite thermal conductivity or non-existent thermal capacity.In an adiabatic irreversible process, dQÂ =Â 0 is not equal to TdS (TdSÂ >Â 0). dQÂ =Â TdSÂ =Â 0 holds for reversible processes only. flame in reversible is also called an isentropic process.  Additionally, an adiabatic process that is irreversible and extracts no work is in an isenthalpic process, such as viscous drag, progressing towards a nonnegative change in entropy. conjugate to entropy, the isothermal process is conjugate to the adiabatic process for reversible transformations.A transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered adiabatic when it is quick enough that no significant heat is transferred between the system and the outside. At the opposite extreme, a transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered isothermal if it is slow enough so that the systems temperature remains constant by heat exchange with the outside. Adiabatic changes in temperature occur due to changes in pressure of a gas while not adding or subtracting any heat. In contrast, free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas.Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g. a piston.  Diesel engines rely on adiabatic heating during their compression stroke to elevate the temperature sufficiently to ignite the fuel.Adiabatic heating also occurs in the Earths atmosphere when an air mass descends, for example, in a katabatic wind or Foehn wind flowing downhill. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcels volume decreases and its temperature increases, thus increasing the internal energy. adiabatic demagnetisation, pileus or lenticular clouds if the air is cooled below the dew point. Also, the contents of an expanding universe (to first order) can be described as an adiabatically cooling fluid. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air decreases, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls and internal energy decreases. (See - Heat death of the universe)Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption.Such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law, or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes.No process is truly adiabatic.  Many processes are close to adiabatic and can be easily approximated by using an adiabatic assumption, but there is always some heat loss; as no perfect insulators exist.    of the working substance must decrease]]The mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process is:   P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} \qquad   specific or molar volume, and:   \gamma = {C_{P} \over C_{V}} = \frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha},    C_{P}   being the specific heat for constant pressure, degrees of freedom divided by 2 (3/2 for monatomic gas, 5/2 for diatomic gas).  Fermi gases.For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that:   P^{1-\gamma}T^{\gamma}= \operatorname{constant} :   VT^\alpha = \operatorname{constant}  where T is an absolute temperature.This can also be written as:   TV^{\gamma - 1} = \operatorname{constant}  ==Lets now look at a common example of adiabatic compression- the compression stroke in a gasoline engine.  We will make a few simplifying assumptions: that the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000ccs (one liter), that the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so  \gamma   = 7/5), and that the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1000 cc volume of uncompressed gas will compress down to 100 cc when the piston goes from bottom to top).  The uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 degC or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100,000 Pa, or about 14.7 PSI, or typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).  P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} = 100,000 \operatorname{pa} * 1000^{7/5} = 100 \times 10^3 * 15.8 \times 10^3 = 1.58 \times 10^9  so our adiabatic constant for this experiment is about 1.58 billion.The gas is now compressed to a 100cc volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas).  The new volume is 100 ccs, but the constant for this experiment is still 1.58 billion:  P * V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} = 1.58 \times 10^9 = P * 100^{7/5}  so solving for P:  P = 1.58 \times 10^9 / {100^{7/5}} = 1.58 \times 10^9 / 630.9 =  2.50 \times 10^6 \operatorname{ Pa}   or about 362 PSI or 24.5 atm.  Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas has also heated the gas and the hotter gas will have a greater pressure even if the volume had not changed.   We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law.Our initial conditions are 100,000 pa of pressure, 1000 cc volume, and 300 K of temperature, so our experimental constant is:  {P V \over T} = \operatorname {constant} = {{ 10^5 * 10^3 } \over {300} } = 3.33 \times 10^5  We know the compressed gas has V = 100 cc and P = 2.50E6 pascals, so we can solve for temperature by simple algebra:  {P V \over {\operatorname{constant}}} = T =   = 751   Thats 751 Kelvins, or 477 Â°C, or 892 Â°F.  This is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a supercharger and intercooler to provide a lower temperature at the same pressure would be advantageous.  A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature which insures immediate ignition of injected fuel.== For an adiabatic free expansion process, the gas is contained in an insulated container and a vacuum. The gas is then allowed to expand in the vacuum. The work done by or on the system is zero, because the volume of the container does not change. The First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.==The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero,  \delta Q=0  . Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics,:  \text{(1)} \qquad d U + \delta W = \delta Q = 0,  where dU is the change in the internal energy of the system and Î´W is work doneby the system.  Any work (Î´W) done must be done at the expense of internal energy U, since no heat Î´Q is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure-volume work Î´W done by the system is defined as:  \text{(2)} \qquad \delta W = P \, dV.  However, P does not remain constant during an adiabatic process butinstead changes along with V.It is desired to know how the values of dP anddV relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by:  \text{(3)} \qquad U = \alpha n R T,   degrees of freedom divided by two, R is the universal gas constant and n is the number of moles in the system (a constant).Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the ideal gas law,  P V = n R T , yields:  \text{(4)} \qquad d U = \alpha n R \, dT                  = \alpha \, d (P V)                  = \alpha (P \, dV + V \, dP).  Equation (4) is often expressed as   d U = n C_{V} \, d T  because   C_{V} = \alpha R  .Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain:   -P \, dV = \alpha P \, dV + \alpha V \, dP, simplify::   - (\alpha + 1) P \, dV = \alpha V \, dP, and divide both sides by PV::   -(\alpha + 1) {d V \over V} = \alpha {d P \over P}.  After integrating the left and right sides from  V_0  to V and from  P_0  to P and changing the sides respectively,:   \ln \left( {P \over P_0} \right)= {-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}} \ln \left( {V \over V_0} \right).  Exponentiate both sides,:   \left( {P \over P_0} \right)=\left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}},   and eliminate the negative sign to obtain:   \left( {P \over P_0} \right)=\left( {V_0 \over V} \right)^{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}.   Therefore,:   \left( {P \over P_0} \right) \left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = 1 and:   P V^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P_0 V_0^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}.  ==The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to:  \text{(1)} \qquad \Delta U = \alpha R n_2T_2 - \alpha R n_1T_1 = \alpha R (n_2T_2 - n_1T_1)  At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to:  \text{(2)} \qquad W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P\, dV  Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true:  \text{(3)} \qquad \Delta U + W = 0  By the previous derivation,:  \text{(4)} \qquad P V^\gamma = \text{constant} = P_1 V_1^\gamma  Rearranging (4) gives:  P = P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma  Substituting this into (2) gives:  W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma\, dV  Integrating,:  W = P_1 V_1^\gamma \frac{V_2^{1-\gamma}-V_1^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}  Substituting   \gamma = \frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha}  ,:  W = - \alpha P_1 V_1^{\gamma} \left( V_2^{1-\gamma} - V_1^{1-\gamma} \right)  Rearranging,:  W = - \alpha P_1 V_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right)  Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),:  W = - \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right)  By the continuous formula,:  \frac{P_2}{P_1}=\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{-\gamma}  Or,:  \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{-1 \over \gamma}=\frac{V_2}{V_1}  Substituting into the previous expression for   W  ,:  W = - \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right)  Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives:  \alpha n R (T_2 - T_1) = \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right)  Simplifying,:  T_2 - T_1 =  T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right)  Simplifying,:  \frac{T_2}{T_1}-1 =  \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1  Simplifying,:  T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}  An adiabat is a curve of constant entropy on the P-V diagram. Properties of adiabats on a P-V diagram are: asymptotically approaches both the V axis and the P axis (just like isotherms).#Each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once.#An adiabat looks similar to an isotherm, except that during an expansion, an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm, so it has a steeper inclination (more vertical).#If isotherms are concave towards the "north-east" direction (45 Â°), then adiabats are concave towards the "east north-east" (31 Â°).#If adiabats and isotherms are graphed severally at regular changes of entropy and temperature, respectively (like altitude on a contour map), then as the eye moves towards the axes (towards the south-west), it sees the density of isotherms stay constant, but it sees the density of adiabats grow.  The exception is very near absolute zero, where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare (see Nernsts theorem).The following diagram is a P-V diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms: The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.The adiabats are isentropic.Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.
