Adolphe began to make his own instruments at an early age, entering two of his flutes and a clarinet into a competition at the age of fifteen. He subsequently studied those two instruments at the Royal School of Singing in Brussels.Having left the school, Sax began to experiment with new instrument designs, while his father continued to produce conventional instruments to bring money into the household. Adolphes first important invention was an improvement of the bass clarinet design which he patented at the age of twenty-four.In 1841, Sax relocated permanently to Paris and began work on a new set of instruments which were exhibited there in 1844. These were valved Bugle (instrument)|bugles, and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were so much more successful than those of his rivals that they became known as saxhorns.
