Abiatharthe evangelist confused Abiathar with Ahimelech, a mistake into which he was led by the constant association of Davidâ€˜s name with Abiathar.  Suggestions made to resolve the difficultyâ€”e.g. that father and son each bore the same double name, or that Abiathar officiated during his fathers lifetime and in his fathers steadâ€”have been supported by great names, but have not been fully accepted. "Abiathar", Encyclopedia Biblica When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the   great-grandson of Eli; slain by Doeg the Edomite-fulfilling part of the curse on the House of Eli that none of his male descendants would live to old age. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia on David descendant Jehoash of Judah: In Rabbinical Literature: As the extermination of the male descendants of David was a divine retribution for the extermination of the priests because of David (comp. I Sam. 22:17-21), Joash escaped death because in the latter case one priest, Abiathar, survived (Sanh. 95b) When David ascended the throne of   and Thummin could not be consulted.  Another version says he was Co-Pontiff with Zadok during King David. He supported Prince Adonijah over Prince Solomon, and was deposed by him and exiled in Anathoth.These appointments continued in force till the end of Davids reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). Zadok now became sole high priest. Abiathars removal from the Priesthood fulfilled that other part of the curse on the House of Eliâ€”that the Priesthood would pass out of the House of Eli.
