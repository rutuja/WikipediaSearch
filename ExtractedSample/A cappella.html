Baroque into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form.  Jewish and Christian music were originally a cappella, and this tradition has existed continuously in both of these religions as well as in Islam.==  Palestrina becoming a major influence on Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor.Eastern Orthodox Christianity Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych are fine examples of this,Opposition to instruments in worship Eastern Orthodox Roman Catholic Mass and Lutheran Divine Divine Service) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times.  Many Mennonites also conduct some or all of their services without instruments.  Sacred Harp, a type of religious folk music, is an a cappella style of religious singing, but is more often sung at singing conventions than at church services.Opponents of musical instruments in the Christian worship believe that such opposition is supported by the New Testament and Church history. The New Testament verses typically referenced are  , which reveal a command for all Christians to sing. There is no reference to instrumental music in the worship of the New Testament or the worship of churches for the first six centuries.  That being said, the reason for such absence is highly debated, though several reasons have been put forth throughout church history. The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles restricting the appropriateness of worship. Such views are the regulative principle of worship, Sola scriptura, the history of hymn in "Christianity". The Hebrew writer spent a great deal of time contrasting Old Testament and New Testament worship, which brings forth a theological understanding. In short, all of the Old Testament and its practices have been replaced by New Testament and teachings of Jesus.   The absence of instrumental music in New Testament worship is significant given the abundance of Old Testament references and commands. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without instrumental music, King David introduced musical instruments into Temple worship based upon a commandment from God. God commanded who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used, as seen in  . organ introduced by Pope Vitalian into a cathedral in Rome around 670.  McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship service and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812. See McKinnon (1965), The Church Fathers and Musical Instruments (Ph.D. Dissertation, Columbia University) p265  Thus, over time, the expression "a cappella" (Italian for "in the manner of the chapel") came to mean exclusively vocal music in contradistinction to the spreading use of the organ in cathedrals.Instruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of Protestant Reformers, including Martin Luther (1483–1546),  John Calvin (1509–1564)  and John Wesley (1703–1791).   The fact that Christendom has periodically grafted instrumental music into the worship service probably obscures, for contemporary adherents, the long, general and conscientious teaching of a cappella. In Sir Walter Scotts The Heart of Midlothian, for example, the heroine, Jeanie Deans, a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added)::The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some kirks without organs that are like ours, and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown. Acceptance of instruments in worshipAn alternate viewpoint is that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that the churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.Since the New Testament never counters this instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. It is striking that there is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the 1st century and a half of the churches (including scripture).  Toward the end of the 2nd century, however, Christians began condemning the actual instruments themselves.  Those who oppose instruments today believe that emerging opposition of these Church Fathers demonstrates a better understanding of Gods desire, but there are significant differences between the teachings of the Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.* Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.  Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is conceded that “the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments.” * Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.  Modern opponents of instruments do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,  who argued that God had allowed David the “evil” of using musical instruments in praise.  Contrary to their teaching, the Old Testament scripture shows that God specifically asked for instruments rather than merely tolerating an evil. Since “a cappella” singing brought a new polyphony with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.  While Zwingli was burning organs in Switzerland&amp;nbsp;– Luther called him a fanatic&amp;nbsp;– the Church of England was burning books of polyphony. == counting of the omer between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.  This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music.  . The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher   or keren (horn) is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue,  and it is only used from Rosh Chodesh Elul through the end of Yom Kippur. The shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service. ==Many Muslim musicians also perform a form of a cappella music called nasheed or Tawasheeh. Some well known composers in the western world include Kamal Uddin, Labbayk, Abdullah Rolle, Naseeha amongst others.
