Abd-ar-Rahman III Emir and Ummayad dynasty Islamic world) for himself.==Abd ar-Rahman was born in CÃ³rdoba, Spain|CÃ³rdoba, the grandson of Abdallah ibn Muhammad|Abdullah, seventh independent Umayyad emir of Al-Andalus. His parents were Abdallahs son Muhammad and Muzna (or Muzayna), a Christian concubine.  His paternal grandmother was also a Christian, the royal infanta Onneca FortÃºnez, daughter of the captive king FortÃºn GarcÃ©s of Pamplona. Abd ar-Rahman was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen Toda of Navarre. He is described as having:  Muhammad was assassinated by his brother Al-Mutarrif, who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour Muhammad had gained in the eyes of their father Abdallah. Al-Mutarrif had accused Muhammad of plotting with the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun, and Muhammad had been imprisoned. According to some sources, the emir himself was behind Muhammads fall, as well as Al-Mutarrifs death in 895. Abd ar-Rahman spent his youth in his mothers harem. Al-Mutarrifs sister, known as al-Sayyida ("the Lady"), was entrusted with his education. She made sure that Abd ar-Rahmans education was conducted with some rigorousness. == Emir Abdallah died at the age of 72. Despite the fact that four of his sons (Aban, Abd al Rahman, Muhammad and Ahmad) were alive at the time of his death, all of them were passed over for succession. Abdallah instead chose as his successor his grandson, Abd al-Rahman III (the son of his first son). This came as no surprise, since Abdallah had already demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways, namely by allowing him to live in his own tower (something he did not allow for any of his sons), and allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions. Most importantly Abdallah gave Abd al-Rahman his ring, the symbol of power, when Abdallah fell ill prior to his death. Abd al-Rahman succeeded Abdallah the day after his death, 16 October 912. Historiographers of the time, such as al-Bayan lMogrib and the Cronica anonima de Abd-ar-Rahman III, state that his succession was "without incident".  At the time, Abd al-Rahman was about 21 or 22 years old. He inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution, his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of CÃ³rdoba. To the north, the Christian Kingdom of Asturias was continuing its program of Reconquista in the Duero valley. To the south in Ifriqiya, the Fatimids had created an independent caliphate that threatened to attract the allegiance of the Muslim population, who had suffered under the harsh rule of Abdullah. On the internal front the discontented Muladi families (Muslims of Iberian origin) represented a constant danger for the CÃ³rdoban emir. The most powerful of the latter was Umar ibn Hafsun, who, from his impregnable fortress of Bobastro, controlled much of eastern Al-Andalus. Arab heritage, Berber heritage.==During the first 20 years of his rule, Abd ar-Rahman avoided military action against the northern Christian kingdoms, Asturias and Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre. The Muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted. Those powerful families were supported by Iberians who were openly or secretly Christians and had acted with the rebels. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab aristocracy. Abd ar-Rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included Christians. .]]He first had to suppress the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. On 1 January 913 an army, led by the eunuch Badr, conquered the fortress of Ã‰cija, at some 50&nbsp;km from the capital. All the citys fortifications were destroyed, aside from the citadel, which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops. In the following spring, after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations, Abd ar-Rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm. His troops were able to recover the coras (provinces) of JaÃ©n (Spanish province)|JaÃ©n and Granada|Elvira, while a cavalry detachment was sent to free MÃ¡laga from ibn Hafsuns siege. He also obtained the capitulation of FiÃ±ana (in the modern province of AlmerÃ­a), after setting fire to its suburbs. Subsequently he moved against the castle of Juviles in the Alpujarras. After devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource, he encircled it. Finding it difficult to bombard with catapults, he ordered the construction of a platform where his siege weapons could be mounted to greater effect, and cut the water supply. The Muladi defenders surrendered after a few days: their lives, apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded, were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir. The campaign continued in a similar vein, lasting for a total of ninety days. Abd ar-Rahman forced the defeated Muladi to send hostages and treasures to CÃ³rdoba, in order to secure their continued submission. Carmona to force them to submit. He initially sent a special corps (hasam) under Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hudayr, governor of Ã‰cija, to Seville, to obtain their submission. This attempt failed, but gained him the support of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hayyay, lord of Carmona, and a cousin of the Sevillan lord, Ahmad ibn Maslama. When the latter was surrounded by Umayyad troops, he sued for help to Ibn Hafsun, but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to Bobastro. Seville finally capitulated on 20 December 913. Ibn al-Mundir al-Qurays, a member of the royal family, was named governor of the city, while the Lord of Carmona obtained the title of vizier. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day, for Abd ar-Rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of Carmona. Muhammad was sent to prison, where he later met his death. Valencia submitted peacefully in 915.==Abd ar-Rahmans next objective was to squash the longstanding rebellion of Ibn Hafsun.His troops left CÃ³rdoba on 7 May 914 and, after a few days, encamped  before the walls of Balda (identified with todays Cuevas de San Marcos). His cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside, while the rest of the troopes moved to Turrus, a castle located in the present municipality of Algarinejo, Granada|Algarinejo, which was surrounded within five days, while its environs were also devastated.The Umayyad army then moved to Bobastro, while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir, which was abandoned by the defenders, allowing Abd ar-Rahmans troops to secure a large booty. Then it was the turn of the castles of OlÃ­as and Reina. The latter fell after a violent fight, leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of MÃ¡laga, which he captured after one day. Abd ar-Rahman then turned and followed the coast by Montemayor, near BenahavÃ­s, Suhayl (Fuengirola) and another castle called Turrus or Turrus Jusayn (identified by Ã‰variste LÃ©vi-ProvenÃ§al as OjÃ©n). He finally arrived  at Algeciras on 1 June 914. He ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied Ibn Hafsun from North Africa. Many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir. The rebellious castles near Algeciras surrendered as soon as the Cordoban army manifested itself.Abd ar-Rahman launched three different campaigns against Ibn Hafsun (who died in 917) and his sons. Among them, Jafar ibn Hafsun held the stronghold of Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman ordered ravaged the citys countryside. Jafar, after two years of siege, escaped the city to ask for help in the northern Christian kingdoms. In the meantime Abd ar-Rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population, after promising them immunity, although 4,000 rebel men escaped in a night sally. The city surrendered on 2 August 932, after a siege of two years. Jerez and CÃ¡diz, as well as the trading republic of Pechina (922). In 927, Abd-ar-Rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel Banu Qasi clan, but was forced to break it off by the intervention of King Jimeno GarcÃ©s of Pamplona.The last of Ibn Hafsun to fall was Hafs, who stood in his powerful fortress of Bobastro. Surrounded by the vizier Said ibn al-Mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city, he resisted the siege for six months, until he surrendered, having his life spared (928). ==The continued expeditions against the Hafsunids did not distract Abd ad-Rahman III from the situation of other regions in al-Andalus, which recognized him only nominally, if not being in open revolt. Most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a tottering position, such as the one of Ã‰vora, who could not prevent the attack of the king of Galicia (future king of LeÃ³n), OrdoÃ±o II of LeÃ³n|OrdoÃ±o II, who captured the city in the summer of 913, taking back a sizable booty and 4,000 prisoners.In much of the eastern and western province, Abd ar-Rahmans authority was completely unrecognized. The lord of Badajoz, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, grandson of Abd-ar-Rahman ibn Marwan al-Yilliqi, not only fortified his city against a possible attack of OrdoÃ±o, but also acted in complete independence from CÃ³rdoba. To avoid the fall of Ã‰vora into the hands of Berber groups of the region, he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and to lowered the walls, though a year later he decided to reconstruct it, giving its control to his ally Masud ibn Sa dun al-Surunbaqi. The Algarve was dominated completely by a muladÃ­ coalition led by Said ibn Mal, who had expelled the Arabs from Beja, and the lords of OcsÃ³noba, Yahya ibn Bakr, and of Niebla, Ibn Ufayr.The absence of royal authority enabled OrdoÃ±o II to easily campaign in this area, his main objective being the city of MÃ©rida, Spain|MÃ©rida, in the summer of  915. Abd ar-Rahman III did not send an army and only several local Berber jefes offered a pointless resistance.==In the next year, despite having quenched only the majority of the rebels,  Abd ar-Rahman III found himself powerful enough to he declared himself as the Caliph of CÃ³rdoba (16 January 929), effectively breaking all allegiance to, and ties with, the Fatimid and Abbasid caliphs.   The caliphate was thought only to belong to the prince who ruled over the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina, and his ancestors had so far contended of the title of emir. But the force of this tradition had weakened over time; and the title increased Abd-ar-Rahmans prestige with his subjects, both in Iberia and Africa. He based his claim to the caliphate on his Umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids.Abd ar-Rhamans move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the Muslims in al-Andalus, as well as the protector of his Christian and Jew subjects. The symbols of his new caliphal power were a sceptre (jayzuran) and the throne (sarir). In the mint he had founded in November 928, Abd ar-Rahman started to coin golden dinars  and silver dirhams, replacing the "al-Andalus" specification with his name.In his new role of caliph, he obtained the surrender of    Berbers conquer Melilla (927), Ceuta (931) and Tangiers (951), which accepted his suzerainty. In 951 he signed a peace with the new king of LeÃ³n, OrdoÃ±o III of LeÃ³n|OrdoÃ±o III, in order to have free hand against the Fatimids whose ships were hararssing the caliphal ones in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahmans force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieged the Fatimid port of Tunis, which bought its safety through a huge sum. In the end he was able to create a sort of protectorate on the northern and central Maghreb, supporting the Idrisid dynasty; the caliphal influence in the area disappeared after a Fatimid offensive in 958, after which abd ar-Rahman kept only the strongholds of Ceuta and Tangiers.==Even before having al-Andalus firmly under his rule, he restarted the war against King OrdoÃ±o II of LeÃ³n, who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the Umayyad territory. In 917 the then-emir had sent a large army under his general Ahmad ibn Abi Abda against LeÃ³n, but this was destroyed near San Esteban de Gormaz in September of that year.Recognizing to have underestimated the power of OrdoÃ±o II, in 920 he mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign. After defeating, on 26 July, king Sancho GarcÃ©s I of Navarre at Junquera, he penetrated in Navarre overcoming the Aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south. Abd ar-Rahman reached the Basque city of Pamplona, which was sacked, its cathedral church being demolished. Ramiro II obtained the throne in 932; a first attempt from him to assist the besieged rebels in Toledo was repelled in 932, despite the Christian king was able to capture Madrid and to score a victory at Osma.In 934, after reasserting supremacy over Pamplona and Ã�lava, he forced Ramiro to retreat to Burgos, and forced the Navarrese queen Toda of Navarre|Toda, his aunt, to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son GarcÃ­a SÃ¡nchez I of Pamplona|GarcÃ­a SÃ¡nchez I. In 937 he conquered some thirty castles in LeÃ³n. Next he turned to Muhammad ibn Hashim at-Tugib, governor of Zaragoza, who had allied with Ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city.Despite early defeats, Ramiro and GarcÃ­a were able to crush the caliphate army in 939 at the Battle of Simancas, most likely, in part, to treason from Arabic elements in the caliphs army. After this defeat, Abd-ar-Rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns. His cause was however helped by FernÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez of Castile, one of the Christian leaders at Simancas, who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against Ramiro. The victory of Simancas enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of Ramiros successor, OrdoÃ±o III of LeÃ³n, in 956. Sancho the Zamora (959) and Oviedo (960) and to overthrow OrdoÃ±o IV.In 950 Abd ar-Rahman received in CÃ³rdoba an embassy from count Borrell II of Barcelona, by which the northern county recognized the caliphal supremacy in exchange for peace and mutual support.==Abd-ar-Rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the    He is known to have openly kept a male as well as female harem.  Saint Pelagius of CÃ³rdoba) who refused the Caliphs advances. However, the love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale, in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to Islam. Either way, enraged, he had the boy tortured and dismembered, thus serving as Christian polemic demonising Muslims.  Abd-ar-Rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside CÃ³rdoba. He died in October 961, and was succeeded by his son al-Hakam II.Abd-ar-Rahman was a patron of arts, and especially architecture. A third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government, a third was hoarded and a third spent on buildings.  After declaring the caliphate, he had a massive palace complex, known as the Medina Azahara, built some 5 kilometers north of CÃ³rdoba.  The Medina Azahara was modelled after the old Umayyad palace in Damascus and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors.Under his reign, CÃ³rdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He expanded the citys library, which would be further enriched by his successors. He also reinforced the Iberian fleet, which became the most powerful in the Mediterranean Europe. Iberian raiders moved up to Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Asturias and North Africa. The colonizers of Fraxinetum came from al-Andalus as well. Pyrenean region. Kingdom of Pamplona. In his immediate ancestry, Abd-ar-Rahman III was thus three-quarters Spanish people|Hispano&ndash;Basque people|Basque, and only one-quarter Arab people|Arab.      * * * * * *      |-
