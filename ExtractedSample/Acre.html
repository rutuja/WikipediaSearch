The most commonly used acres today are the international acre and, in the United States, the survey acre.  The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land.The acre is related to the square mile, with 640 acres making up one square mile.  One mile is 5280 feet (1760 yards).  Divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof.  If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of 1/2 mile (880 yards) and is 1/4 square mile in area, or 160 acres.  These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being 1/4 mile long, and being 1/16th of a square mile in area, or 40 acres.  In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase "the back 40" would refer to the 40 acre parcel to the back of the farm.  Most of the US midwest is on square mile grids for surveying purposes. square feet chain (66&amp;nbsp;ft) square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards, or   on a side.  As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any perimeter enclosing 43,560&amp;nbsp;square feet is an acre in size.The acre is often used to express areas of land in the U.S and in countries where the Imperial System is still in use.  , the acre is not used officially in the United Kingdom. In the metric system, the hectare is commonly used for the same purpose. An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare. Association football (soccer) pitch.

Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres. Since the difference between the U.S. and International acre is only approximately 0.016 square metres (24.8 square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed.The United States survey acre is approximately 4,046.872 609 874 252 square metres; its exact value (  m 2 ) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre = 39.37&amp;nbsp;inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order. perches or roods is common. 1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:* 4,046.8564224 square metres* 0.40468564224 hectare (A square with 100 m sides has an area of 1 hectare.)1 United States survey acre is equal to:* 4,046.87261 square metres* 0.404687261 hectare1&amp;nbsp;acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units: square feet)* 1 chain × 10 chains (1 chain = 66 feet = 22 yards = 4 rods = 100 link (unit)|links)* 1&amp;nbsp;acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet (a square)* 4,840 square yards rod (1 square rod is 0.00625&amp;nbsp;acre) chains* roods* A chain by a furlong (chain 22 yards, furlong 220 yards)*  1/640 (0.0015625) square mile (1 square mile is equal to 640&amp;nbsp;acres)  Swedish åker, German Acker, Dutch akker, Greek αγρός (agros). chain and furrow long.Before the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221 square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of "acre" existed as there were German states.Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and, subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of: Edward I, Edward III, Henry VIII, George IV and* Queen Victoria – the British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, Rood (measurement)|roods, and Perch (unit)|perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in carucates, virgates, Oxgang|bovates, nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.
