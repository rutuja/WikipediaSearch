Accelerated Graphics Port OEM driver support was minimal.  bus with shared bandwidth. This led to the development of AGP, a "bus" dedicated to graphics adapters. address and buses which allow the graphics controller to issue new AGP requests and commands at the same time with other AGP data flowing via the main 32 address/data (AD) lines. This results in improved overall AGP data throughput. texture storage, allowing the graphics card to access them directly.  The maximum amount of system memory available to AGP is defined as the AGP Aperture (computer memory)|aperture.  P5 Pentium Pentium and P6 Pentium II processors. Intel introduced AGP support with the i440LX Slot 1 chipset on the August 26, 1997, and a flood of products followed from all the major system board vendors.  , Intel, accessed October 18, 2007.  VIA Apollo SiS 5591/5592, ALI Aladdin FIC demonstrated the first Socket 7 AGP system board in November 1997 as the FIC PA-2012 based on the VIA Apollo VP3 chipset, followed very quickly by the EPoX P55-VP3 also based on the VIA VP3 chipset which was first to market.  Rendition VÃ©ritÃ© Voodoo Banshee, Intel i740, ATI Rage S3 ViRGE GX/2. Some early AGP boards used graphics processors built around PCI and were simply bridged to AGP. This resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus, with the only improvement used being the 66&nbsp;MHz bus clock, with its resulting doubled bandwidth over PCI, and bus exclusivity. Examples of such cards were the Voodoo Banshee, VÃ©ritÃ© V2200, Millennium II, and S3 ViRGE GX/2. Intels i740 was explicitly designed to exploit the new AGP feature set. In fact it was designed to texture only from AGP memory, making PCI versions of the board difficult to implement (local board RAM had to emulate AGP memory.)Microsoft first introduced AGP support into Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2 version 1111 or 950B) via the USB SUPPLEMENT to OSR2 patch.  After applying the patch the Windows 95 system became Windows 95 version 4.00.950 B. The first Windows NT-based operating system to receive AGP support was Windows NT 4.0 with service pack 3, introduced in 1997. Linux support for AGP enhanced fast data transfers was first added in 1999 with the implementation of the AGPgart kernel module.Intel released "AGP specification 1.0" in 1997.  It included both the 1Ã— and 2Ã— speeds.  Specification 2.0 documented AGP 4Ã—  and 3.0 documented 8Ã—.  , Intel, accessed October 9, 2011.

Compatibility section.==  Macintosh)]] AGP ProIt is an official extension for cards that required more electrical power. It is a longer slot with additional pins for that purpose. AGP Pro cards were usually workstation-class cards used to accelerate professional computer-aided design applications employed in the fields of architecture, machining, engineering, simulations, and similar fields.64-bit AGPA 64-bit channel was once proposed as an optional standard for AGP 3.0 in draft documents,  but it was dropped in the final version of the standard.The standard allows 64-bit transfer for AGP8Ã— Reads, Writes, and Fast Writes; 32-bit transfer for PCI operations.==A number of non-standard variations of the AGP interface have been produced by manufacturers.Internal AGP interface SiS for the north bridge controllers with integrated graphics. The original version supports same bandwidth as AGP 8Ã—, while Ultra-AGPII has maximum 3.2GB/s bandwidth.PCI-based AGP ports PCI bus on a PCI Express motherboard. It is a technology used on motherboards made by Elitegroup Computer Systems|ECS, intended to allow an existing AGP card to be used in a new motherboard instead of requiring a PCIe card to be obtained (since the introduction of PCIe graphics cards few motherboards provide AGP slots). An "AGP Express" slot is basically a PCI slot (with twice the electrical power) with an AGP connector. It offers backward compatibility with AGP cards, but provides incomplete support  (some AGP cards do not work with AGP Express) and reduced performanceâ€”the card is forced to use the shared PCI bus at its lower bandwidth, rather than having exclusive use of the faster AGP.:;AGI: The ASRock Graphics Interface (AGI) is a proprietary variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard. Its purpose is to provide AGP-support for ASRock motherboards that use chipsets lacking native AGP support. However, it is not fully compatible wih AGP, and several video card chipsets are known not to be supported. EpoX Advanced Graphics eXtended (AGX) is another proprietary AGP variant with the same advantages and disadvantages as AGI. User manuals recommend not using AGP 8Ã— ATI cards with AGX slots.:;XGP: The Biostar Xtreme Graphics Port is another AGP variant, also with the same advantages and disadvantages as AGI and AGX.PCIe based AGP ports MSI to offer limited backwards compatibility with AGP. It is, effectively, a modified PCIe slot allowing for performance comparable to an AGP 4Ã—/8Ã— slot,  but does not support all AGP cards; the manufacturer published a list of some cards and chipsets that work with the modified slot.   backward and forward compatible Radeon 9500/9700/9800(R350) (but not 9600/9800(R360)). Some Geforce 6200 and Geforce 6600 cards will function with AGP 1.0 (3.3v) slots.AGP Pro cards will not fit into standard slots, but standard AGP cards will work in a Pro slot. Motherboards equipped with a Universal AGP Pro slot will accept a 1.5 V or 3.3 V card in either the AGP Pro or standard AGP configuration, a Universal AGP card, or a Universal AGP Pro card.Some cards incorrectly have dual notches, and some motherboards incorrectly have fully open slots, allowing a card to be plugged into a slot that does not support the correct signaling voltage, which may damage card or motherboard. Some incorrectly-designed older 3.3 V cards have the 1.5 V key. Apple Power CPU architecture (e.g., PC, Apple) may not work with others due to firmware issues.  current drawn from the various rails is given in the specifications for the various versions. For example, if maximum current is drawn from all supplies and all voltages are at their specified upper limits,  an AGP&nbsp;3.0 slot can supply up to 48.25&nbsp;watts;  this figure can be used to specify a power supply conservatively, but in practice a card is unlikely ever to draw more than 40&nbsp;W from the slot, with many using less. AGP Pro provides additional power up to 110&nbsp;W.  Many AGP cards had additional power connectors to supply them with more power than the slot could provide.By 2010 few new motherboards had AGP slots. No new motherboard chipsets were equipped with AGP support, but motherboards continued to be produced with older chipsets with support for AGP.Graphics processors of this period use PCI-Express, a general-purpose (not restricted to graphics) standard that supports higher data transfer rates and Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex. To create AGP-compatible graphics cards, those chips require an additional PCIe-to-AGP bridge-chip to convert PCIe signals to and from AGP signals. This incurs additional board costs due to the need for the additional bridge chip and for a separate AGP-designed circuit board. Radeon HD 2400, 3450, 3650, Radeon R700|4350, 4650, and 4670. The HD 5000 AGP series mentioned in the catalyst software was never available. There were many problems with the AMD Catalyst 11.2 - 11.6 AGP hotfix drivers under Windows 7 with the HD 4000 series AGP video cards;  use of 10.12 or 11.1 AGP hotfix drivers is the recommended  workaround. Several of the vendors listed above make available past versions of the AGP drivers.
