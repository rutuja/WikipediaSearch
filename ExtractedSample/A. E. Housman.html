Through its song-setting the poetry became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself. Lucan are still considered authoritative.The eldest of seven children, Housman was born at Valley House in Fockbury, a hamlet on the outskirts of   and sister Clemence Housman also became writers. Greats curriculum, and thus he failed to obtain a degree.  Though some explain Housmans unexpected failure in his final exams as a result of Jacksons rejection,  most biographers adduce a variety of reasons, indifference to philosophy, overconfidence in his praeternatural gifts, a contempt for inexact learning, and enjoyment of idling away his time with Jackson, conjoined with news of his fathers desperate illness as the more immediate and germane causes.    The failure left him with a deep sense of humiliation, and a determination to vindicate his genius. clerk in the Patent Office in London and arranged a job there for Housman as well.  They shared a flat with Jacksons brother Adalbert until 1885 when Housman moved to lodgings of his own. Moses Jackson moved to India in 1887. When Jackson returned briefly to England in 1889 to marry, Housman not only was not invited to the wedding but knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. Adalbert Jackson died in 1892. Housman continued pursuing classical studies independently and published scholarly articles on such authors as Horace, Propertius, Ovid, Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles.  He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered the professorship of Latin at University College London, which he accepted.  Many years later, the UCL academic staff common room was dedicated to his memory as the Housman Room.The pleasures Housman enjoyed included gastronomy, flying in aeroplanes, and frequent visits to France, where he read "books which were banned in Britain as pornographic".  A fellow don described him as being "descended from a long line of maiden aunts". Critchley (1988).  Although Housmans early work and his sphere of responsibilities as professor included both   Astronomicon in five volumes. He also edited works of   quotes examples of these attacks, noting that they "were often savage in the extreme."  Gow also relates how Housman intimidated his students, sometimes reducing them to tears. According to Gow, Housman could never remember his students names, maintaining that "had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension." One notable pupil was Enoch Powell.  Housman found his true vocation in classical studies and treated poetry as a secondary activity. He did not speak about his poetry in public until 1933 when he gave a lecture, "The Name and Nature of Poetry", in which he argued that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect.Housman died aged 77,  in Cambridge. His ashes are buried near St Laurences Church, Ludlow, Shropshire.  The University of Worcester has acknowledged Housmans local connection by naming a new building after him.== During his years in London, A. E. Housman completed A Shropshire Lad, a cycle of 63 poems.  After several publishers had turned it down, he published it at his own expense in 1896. The volume surprised both his colleagues and students.  At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success, and its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before World War I, when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers.  A Shropshire Lad has been in print continuously since May 1896. The poems are pervaded by deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation.  Housman wrote most of them while living in Highgate, London, before ever visiting that part of Shropshire (about thirty miles from his home), which he presented in an idealised pastoral light, as his land of lost content.  Housman himself acknowledged the influence of the songs of William Shakespeare, the Scottish Border ballads and Heinrich Heine, but specifically denied any influence of Greek and Latin classics in his poetry.==In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death.  These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in A Shropshire Lad but lack the consistency of his previously published work. He published them as Last Poems (1922) because he felt his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. This proved true. After his death Housmans brother, Laurence Housman|Laurence, published further poems which appeared in More Poems (1936) and Collected Poems (1939). Housman also wrote a parodic Fragment of a Greek Tragedy, in English, and humorous poems published posthumously under the title Unkind to Unicorns. John Sparrow found statements in a letter written late in Housmans life which describe how his poems came into existence: Poetry was for him ...a morbid secretion, as the pearl is for the oyster. The desire, or the need, did not come upon him often, and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed; then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort, or any consciousness of composition on his part. Sometimes they wanted a little alteration, sometimes none; sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later, spontaneously or with a little coaxing; sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head. That .... was a long and laborious process.  Sparrow himself adds, "How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in A Shropshire Lad. Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were given him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which." Collected Poems Penguin, Harmondsworth (1956), preface by John Sparrow. ==In 1942 Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled "A. E. Housmans De Amicitia" in the British Library, with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A. E. Housmans homosexuality and his love for Jackson.  Despite the conservative nature of the times, Housman, as distinct from the prudence of his public life, was quite open in his poetry, and especially his A Shropshire Lad, about his deeper sympathies. Poem 30 of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how "Fear contended with desire": "Others, I am not the first / have willed more mischief than they durst". In More Poems, he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love break his friendship, and must be carried silently to the grave: . Because I liked you betterThan suits a man to sayIt irked you, and I promisedTo throw the thought away.To put the world between usWe parted, stiff and dry;Goodbye, said you, forget me.I will, no fear, said IIf here, where clover whitensThe dead mans knoll, you pass,And no tall flower to meet youStarts in the trefoiled grass,Halt by the headstone namingThe heart no longer stirred,And say the lad that loved youWas one that kept his word.  His poem, "Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?", written after the trial of Oscar Wilde, addressed more general social injustice towards homosexuality.  In the poem the prisoner is suffering "for the colour of his hair", a natural, given attribute which, in a clearly coded reference to homosexuality, is reviled as "nameless and abominable" (recalling the legal phrase peccatum horribile, inter christianos non nominandum, "the horrible sin, not to be named amongst Christians").==Housmans poetry, especially A Shropshire Lad, provided texts for a significant number of British, and in particular English, composers in the first half of the 20th century.  The national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in English music. The first was probably the cycle A Shropshire Lad set by Arthur Somervell in 1904, who had begun to develop the concept of the English song-cycle in his version of Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennysons Maud and other poems|Maud a little previously. Ralph Vaughan Williams produced his most famous settings of six songs, the cycle On Wenlock Edge, for string quartet, tenor and piano (dedicated to Gervase Elwes) in 1909,  and it became very popular after Elwes recorded it with the London String Quartet and Frederick B. Kiddle in 1917. Between 1909 and 1911 George Butterworth produced settings in two collections or cycles, as Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad, and Bredon Hill and other songs. He also wrote an orchestral tone poem on A Shropshire Lad (first performed at Leeds Festival under Arthur Nikisch in 1912).  First World War and became assimilated into them. This was reinforced when their foremost interpreter and performer, Gervase Elwes (who had initiated the music festivals at Brigg in Lincolnshire at which Percy Grainger and others had developed their collections of country music ) died in a horrific accident in 1921. Elwes had been closely identified with English wartime morale, having given six benefit performances of The Dream of Gerontius on consecutive nights in 1916, and many concerts in France in 1917 for British soldiers.  David Downes includes a setting of "March" on his CD The Rusted Wheel of Things.== A Taste A Taste for Death, the seventh in her Adam Dalgliesh series. The last words of the poem "On Wenlock Edge" are used by Audrey R. Langer for the title of the 1989 novel Ashes Under Uricon. The Nobel Prize winning novelist Patrick White named his 1955 novel The Tree of Man after a line in A Shropshire Lad and Arthur C. Clarkes first novel, Against the Fall of Night, is taken from a work in Housmans More Poems. The 2009 novel Bloods a Rover by James Ellroy takes its title from Housmans poem "Reveille",  and a line from Housmans poem XVI "How Clear, How Lovely Bright", was used for the title of the last Inspector Morse book The Remorseful Day by Colin Dexter. Blue Remembered Hills, a television play by Dennis Potter, takes its title from "Into My Heart an Air That Kills" from A Shropshire Lad,  the cycle also providing the name for the James Bond film Die Another Day: "But since the man that runs away / Lives to die another day".==*A Shropshire Lad (1896)*  (1922)*  (1924)*  (1936)*  (1940)*Collected Poems (1939); the poems included in this volume but not the three above are known as Additional Poems.
