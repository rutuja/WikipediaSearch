The word is thought to have its origin in the Aramaic language, in which ibra (אברא) means "I have created" and kdibra (כדברא) which means "through my speech",  providing a translation of abracadabra as "created as I say", thus its use in magic. The first known mention of the word was in the second century AD in a book called Liber Medicinalis (sometimes known as  De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima) by   to the Roman emperor Caracalla, who prescribed that malaria  sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle:   A - B - R - A - C - A - D - A - B - R - AA - B - R - A - C - A - D - A - B - RA - B - R - A - C - A - D - A - BA - B - R - A - C - A - D - AA - B - R - A - C - A - DA - B - R - A - C - AA - B - R - A - CA - B - R - AA - B - RA - BA  Geta and Alexander Severus, were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.  It was used as a magical formula by the Gnostics of the sect of Basilides in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.    It is found on Abraxas stones which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.The Puritan minister Increase Mather dismissed the word as bereft of power. Daniel Defoe also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the Great Plague of London.   But Aleister Crowley regarded it as possessing great power; he said its true form is abrahadabra.  The word is now commonly used as an incantation by stage magicians. It is also applied contemptuously to a conception or hypothesis which purports to be a simple solution of apparently insoluble phenomena.In the Nintendo/GameFreak video game franchise "Pokémon", there are three creatures in the same evolutionary chain named Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam (the third of which is also an alleged magic word used by stage magicians).The incantation "Avada Kedavra" is known as the Killing Curse in the "Harry Potter" novel series. During an audience interview at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 April 2004, series author J. K. Rowling had this to say about the fictional Killing Curses etymology: "Does anyone know where avada kedavra came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of abracadabra, which means let the thing be destroyed. Originally, it was used to cure illness and the thing was the illness, but I decided to make it the thing as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine."  Abra Kadabra appear magic to present-day people, and later gains actual magic powers.Mr. Kadabra is a member of the 13th floor witches, in Vertigos Fables (comics)|Fables series. *Abrahadabra*Barbarous names Hocus Pocus*Open sesame Presto*Sator Square  *   Robert Todd Carroll, Skeptics Dictionary* *</body></html>
