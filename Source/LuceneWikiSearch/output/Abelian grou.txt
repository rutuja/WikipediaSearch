Abelian groupgroup in operation to generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers. They are named after Niels Henrik Abel.  abstract algebra, module and a vector space, being its refinements. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their nonabelian group|non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research. operation "â€¢" elements a and b to form another element denoted  . The symbol "â€¢" is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation,  , must satisfy five requirements known as the abelian group axioms:;Closure: For all a, b in A, the result of the operation a â€¢ b is also in A.;Associativity: For all a, b and c in A, the equation (a â€¢ b) â€¢ c = a â€¢ (b â€¢ c) holds.;Identity element: There exists an element e in A, such that for all elements a in A, the equation  e â€¢ a = a â€¢ e = a  holds.;Inverse element: For each a in A, there exists an element b in A such that a â€¢ b = b â€¢ a = e, where e is the identity element.;Commutativity: For all a, b in A, a â€¢ b = b â€¢ a.More compactly, an abelian group is a commutative group (mathematics)|group. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a "non-abelian group" or "non-commutative group".==There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups â€” additive and multiplicative.{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"|-! Convention! Operation! Identity! Powers! Inverse|-! Addition| x + y || 0 || nx || âˆ’x|-! Multiplication| x * y or xy || e or 1| x n | x âˆ’1 |}Generally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for module (mathematics)|modules. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered.==To verify that a finite group is abelian, a table (matrix) - known as a Cayley table - can be constructed in a similar fashion to a multiplication table. If the group is G = {g 1  = e, g 2 , ..., g n } under the operation â‹…, the (i, j)th entry of this table contains the product g i  â‹… g j . The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.This is true since if the group is abelian, then g i  â‹… g j  = g j  â‹… g i . This implies that the (i, j)th entry of the table equals the (j, i)th entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal. For the integers and the operation addition "+", denoted (Z,+), the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the additive identity, every integer n has an additive inverse, âˆ’n, and the addition operation is commutative since  m + n = n + m  for any two integers m and n. integers modulo n, Z/nZ. ring is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a commutative ring the invertible elements, or unit (ring theory)|units, form an abelian multiplicative group. In particular, the real numbers are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication. direct sums of abelian groups are again abelian. rotation matrices.  Norwegian mathematician solvable by radicals. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background. module over ring Z of integers. In fact, the modules over Z can be identified with the abelian groups. modules over the principal ideal domain Z) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of finitely generated abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form Z/p k Z for p prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of Z.If f, g : G &nbsp;â†’&nbsp; H are two group homomorphisms between abelian groups, then their sum f + g, defined by (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if H is a non-abelian group.) The set Hom(G, H) of all group homomorphisms from G to H thus turns into an abelian group in its own right. cardinality of the largest set of linearly independent elements of the group. The integers and the rational numbers have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals. integers modulo n, Z/nZ, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of Georg Frobenius and Ludwig Stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of linear algebra.==The fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group G can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime number|prime-power order. This is a special case of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups when G has zero rank of an abelian group|rank.The cyclic group  \mathbb{Z}_{mn}  of order mn is isomorphic to the direct sum of  \mathbb{Z}_m  and  \mathbb{Z}_n  if and only if m and n are coprime. It follows that any finite abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form: \mathbb{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_u} in either of the following canonical ways:* the numbers k 1 ,...,k u  are powers of primes divides k 2 , which divides k 3 , and so on up to k u .For example,  \mathbb{Z}_{15}  can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5:  \mathbb{Z}_{15}\cong\{0, 5, 10\}\oplus\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12\} . The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are group isomorphism|isomorphic.For another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either  \mathbb{Z}_8  (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8),  \mathbb{Z}_4\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2  (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or  \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2 .See also list of small groups for finite abelian groups of order 16 or less.== automorphisms of a given finite abelian group G. To do this, one uses the fact (which will not be proved here) that if G splits as a direct sum H  \oplus  K of subgroups of coprime order, then Aut(H  \oplus  K)  \cong  Aut(H)  \oplus  Aut(K). Sylow p-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of p). Fix a prime p and suppose the exponents e i  of the cyclic factors of the Sylow p-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:: e_1\leq e_2 \leq\cdots\leq e_n for some n > 0. One needs to find the automorphisms of: \mathbb{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^{e_n}}. One special case is when n = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow p-subgroup P. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite cyclic group can be used. Another special case is when n is arbitrary but e i  = 1 for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n. Here, one is considering P to be of the form: \mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p, so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension n over the finite field of p elements  \mathbb{F}_p . The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so: \mathrm{Aut}(P)\cong\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{F}_p), where GL is the appropriate general linear group. This is easily shown to have order: |\mathrm{Aut}(P)|=(p^n-1)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}). In the most general case, where the e i  and n are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines e_r = e_k^{\,}\} and: c_k=\mathrm{min}\{r|e_r=e_k^{\,}\} then one has in particular d k  â‰¥ k, c k  â‰¤ k, and: |\mathrm{Aut}(P)| = \left(\prod_{k=1}^n{p^{d_k} - p^{k-1}}\right)\left(\prod_{j=1}^n{(p^{e_j})^{n-d_j}}\right)\left(\prod_{i=1}^n{(p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}}\right). One can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see  ).Ð¢he simplest infinite abelian group is the infinite cyclic group Z. Any finitely generated abelian group A is isomorphic to the direct sum of r copies of Z and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many cyclic groups of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number r, called the Rank of an abelian group|rank of A, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.By contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete.  s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible (Baers criterion). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called reduced. Two important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are torsion groups and torsion-free groups, examplified by the groups Q/Z (periodic) and Q (torsion-free).==An abelian group is called  s.==An abelian group is called torsion-free if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of torsion-free abelian groups have been extensively studied:* Free abelian groups, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of Z Cotorsion and algebraically compact torsion-free groups such as the p-adic integer|p-adic integers* Slender groupsAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called mixed. If A is an abelian group and T(A) is its torsion subgroup then the factor group A/T(A) is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of A, so the torsion-free factor cannot be realized as a subgroup of A and A is not isomorphic to T(A) âŠ• A/T(A). Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.==One of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group A is its   subset of A. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of Q and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank r is a subgroup of Q r . On the other hand, the group of p-adic integer|p-adic integers Z p  is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z p  n  with different n are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.  pure and basic subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by Irving Kaplansky, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Fuchs, Phillip Griffiths, and David Arnold, as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in Lecture Notes in Mathematics for more recent results.== ring is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:* Tensor product* Corners results on countable torsion-free groups* Shelahs work to remove cardinality restrictionsMany large abelian groups possess a natural topology, which turns them into topological groups. homomorphisms between category Ab, the prototype of an abelian category. Boolean algebras, are Decidability (logic)|undecidable. Hence it is surprising that Tarskis student Szmielew (1955) proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research: rank 1 case are well understood;*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in computational group theory.Moreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the  s? In the 1970s, Saharon Shelah proved that the Whitehead problem is: Undecidable in ZFC, the conventional axiomatic set theory from which nearly all of present day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;* Undecidable even if ZFC is augmented by taking the generalized continuum hypothesis as an axiom; constructibility (see statements true in L).Among mathematical adjectives derived from the proper name of a mathematician, the word "abelian" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase a, rather than an uppercase A, indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.
