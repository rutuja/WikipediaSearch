Active Server Pages script engine Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack (ca. 1998), it was subsequently included as a free component of Windows Server (since the initial release of Windows 2000 Server). ASP.NET has superseded ASP. session that variables from libraries such as Dynamic-link library|DLLs.Web pages with the .asp file extension use ASP, although some Web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes (e.g. still using the more common .htm or .html extension).Pages with the .aspx extension use compiled ASP.NET (based on Microsofts .NET Framework), which makes them faster and more robust than server-side scripting in ASP, which is interpreted at run-time; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term Classic ASP for the original technology.Programmers write most ASP pages using VBScript, but any other Active Scripting engine can be selected instead with the  @Language  directive or the     syntax. JScript (Microsofts implementation of ECMAScript) is the other language that is usually available. PerlScript (a derivative of Perl) and others are available as third-party installable Active Scripting engines.There are only a few alternative implementations, and most of them are implemented in Java.  Unlike the Mono ASP.NET implementation, these versions tend to be quite different compared to the Microsoft interpreter, so not all scripts written for the Microsoft platform may be supported.Example of these include:* Sun ONE Active Server Pages This implementation was discontinued and is no longer available. Some older versions still exist on the World Wide Web. *   This is a Java Servlet which supports the ASP syntax and VBScript. The latest release is 0.2.3, released on June 14, 2004.*   This is a Fork_(software_development) | fork of the Arrowhead ASP implementation  with updated libraries and optimizations for the Cloud Foundry platform. It seems to be quite recent, but the differences with Arrowhead are few.  Template processor* ASP.NET <!--==    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
