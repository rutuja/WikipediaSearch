Abugidausing Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, an abugida developed by Christian missionaries for Aboriginal Canadian languages]]   An abugida   (from   letter, and vowel notation is obligatory but secondary. This contrasts with a full alphabet, in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an abjad, in which vowel marking is absent or optional. (In less formal treatments, all three systems are commonly called alphabets.) Abugidas include the extensive Brahmic family of scripts of South and Southeast Asia. typology of writing systems.  It is an Ethiopian name of the Geez alphabet|Geâ€˜ez script, â€™Ã¤ bu gi da, taken from four letters of that script the way abecedary derives from Latin a be ce de. As Daniels used the word, an abugida contrasts with a syllabary, where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to each another, and with an alphabet proper, where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels. The term alphasyllabary was suggested for the Indic scripts in 1997 by William Bright, following South Asian linguistic usage, to convey the idea that "they share features of both alphabet and syllabary".

In general, a letter of an abugida transcribes a consonant. Letters are written as a linear sequence, in most cases left to right. Vowels are written through modification of these consonant letters, either by means of diacritics (which may not follow the direction of writing the letters) or by changes in the form of the letter itself.Vowels not preceded by a consonant may be represented with a zero consonant letter, modified to indicate the vowel, or separate letters for each vowel, that are distinct from the corresponding dependent vowel signs. Consonants not followed by a vowel may be represented with:*a modification which explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel (virama),*a lack of vowel marking (often with ambiguity between no vowel and a default inherent vowel),*vowel marking for a short or neutral vowel such as schwa (with ambiguity between no vowel and that short or neutral vowel), conjunct consonant letters where two or more letters are graphically joined in a Typographic ligature|ligature, or*dependent consonant signs, which may be smaller or differently placed versions of the full consonant letters, or may be distinct signs altogether.There are three principal families of abugidas, depending on whether vowels are indicated by modifying consonants by diacritics, distortion, or orientation. *The oldest and largest is the Brahmic family of India and Southeast Asia, in which vowels are marked with diacritics and syllable-final consonants, when they occur, are indicated with Typographic ligature|ligatures, diacritics, or with a special virama|vowel-canceling mark. Ethiopic family, vowels are marked by modifying the shapes of the consonants, and one of these pulls double duty for final consonants. Cree family, vowels are marked by rotating or flipping the consonants, and final consonants are indicated with either special diacritics or superscript forms of the main initial consonants.TÄ�na of the Maldives has dependent vowels and a zero vowel sign, but no inherent vowel.{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"!Feature!!North Indic!!South Indic!!Thaana!!Ethiopic!!Canadian|- Vowel after Dependent sign Fused diacritic||Rotate/reflect|- Initial vowel 1 per Zero consonant Glottal stop||Zero consonant|- Absence of vowel sign||colspan="2"| ,  ,  , or  ||N/A|| ||N/A|- Virama (zero No|- Consonant ligatures||Conjunct Stack or No|- Final consonant All|- Distinct final Western only|- Final consonant Top or Small raised,  or full letter|}==  Kashmiri and some other languages of Pakistan and India) and mainland Southeast Asia (Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia; but not Malaysia or Vietnam).  The primary division is into North Indic scripts used in Northern India, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and Southern Indic scripts used in South India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.South Indic letter forms are very rounded; North Indic less so, though Oriya script|Oriya, Golmol and Litumol of Nepal script are rounded.Most North Indic scripts full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top, with Gujarati script an exception; South Indic scripts do not.Indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) around the consonants, often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel. If a consonant has no vowel sign, this indicates a default vowel. Vowel diacritics may appear above, below, to the left, to the right, or around the consonant.  mora a consonant letter represents, either with or without a marked vowel, is called an akshara. ]]{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"|+ Diacritic placement in Brahmic abugidas! position! syllable! pronunciation! base form! script|-| above || à¤•à¥‡ ||   || rowspan=4 | à¤•   || rowspan=4 | Devanagari|-| below || à¤•à¥� ||  |-| left || à¤•à¤¿ ||  |-| right || à¤•à¥‹ ||  |- Tamil|- Khmer|- Kannada|}In many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like   -i, falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced. For example, the game cricket in Hindi is à¤•à¥�à¤°à¤¿à¤•à¥‡à¤Ÿ krikeÅ£; the diacritic for   appears before the consonant cluster  , not before the  . A more unusual example is seen in the Batak alphabet: Here the syllable bim is written ba-ma-i-(virama). That is, the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable.In many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding the bare consonant. In   and South Asian scripts of Unicode.) Thus a closed syllable such as kal requires two akshara to write.The RÃ³ng script used for the Lepcha language goes further than other Indic abugidas, in that a single akshara can represent a closed syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable   would be written as something like  , here with an underring representing   and an overcross representing the diacritic for final  . Most other Indic abugidas can only indicate a very limited set of final consonants with diacritics, such as   or  , if they can indicate any at all.== , an abugida of Eritrea and Ethiopia]]In Ethiopic, where the term abugida originates, the diacritics have been fused to the consonants to the point that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters. Children learn each modification separately, as in a syllabary; nonetheless, the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant is readily apparent, unlike the case in a true syllabary.Though now an abugida, the Geez alphabet, until the advent of Christianity (ca. 350 CE), had originally been what would now be termed an abjad. In the Geez  abugida (or fidel), the base form of the letter (also known as fidel) may be altered. For example, áˆ€ hÃ¤   (base form), áˆ� hu (with a right-side diacritic that doesnt alter the letter), áˆ‚ hi (with a subdiacritic that compresses the consonant, so it is the same height), áˆ… hÉ™   or   (where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm).== In the family known as Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, vowels are indicated by changing the orientation of the akshara. Each vowel has a consistent orientation; for example, Inuktitut á�± pi, á�³ pu, á�¸ pa; á‘Ž ti, á‘� tu, á‘• ta. Although there is a vowel inherent in each, all rotations have equal status and none can be identified as basic. Bare consonants are indicated either by separate diacritics, or by superscript versions of the aksharas; there is no vowel-killer mark.==Consonantal scripts ("abjads") are normally written without indication of many vowels. However in some contexts like teaching materials or scriptures, Arabic and Hebrew are written with full indication of vowels via diacritic marks (harakat, niqqud) making them effectively abugidas. The Brahmic and Ethiopic families are thought to have originated from the Semitic abjads by the addition of vowel marks.<!-- Not best place to mention Thaana since not an abjadThaana is similar, with all vowels marked with diacritics, and no inherent vowel. However, the absence of a vowel is also marked with a diacritic, as in many Indic abugidas. Thaana developed among a population that was already literate in an Indic abugida.--> Kurdish in Uighur in Xinjiang, Peoples Republic of China) are fully voweled, but since the vowels are full letters rather than diacritics, and there are no inherent vowels, these are considered alphabets rather than abugidas.== Phagspa was derived from the Tibetan abugida, but all vowels are written in-line rather than as diacritics. However, it retains the features of having an inherent vowel /a/ and having distinct initial vowel letters.==Pahawh Hmong is a non-segmental script that indicates syllable onsets and syllable rime|rimes, such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants. Thus it is not segmental and cannot be considered an abugida. However, it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Most syllables are written with two letters in the order rimeâ€“onset (typically vowel-consonant), even though they are pronounced as onset-rime (consonant-vowel), rather like the position of the   vowel in Devanagari, which is written before the consonant. Pahawh is also unusual in that, while an inherent rime   (with mid tone) is unwritten, it also has an inherent onset  . For the syllable  , which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is   that is written. Thus it is the rime (vowel) which is basic to the system.== segmental scripts. For example, the Meroitic script of ancient Sudan did not indicate an inherent a (one symbol stood for both m and ma, for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel.== Kurdish script than to the Brahmic scripts. The Gabelsberger shorthand system and its derivatives modify the following consonant to represent vowels. The Pollard script, which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates tone (linguistics)|tone.  Pitman shorthand uses straight strokes and quarter-circle marks in different orientations as the principal "alphabet" of consonants; vowels are shown as light and heavy dots, dashes and other marks in one of 3 possible positions to indicate the various vowel-sounds.  However, to increase writing-speed Pitman has rules for   using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel-marks can be dispensed with. logographic scripts. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese hiragana syllabary: ã�‹ ka, ã�� ki, ã�� ku, ã�‘ ke, ã�“ ko have nothing in common to indicate k; while ã‚‰ ra, ã‚Š ri, ã‚‹ ru, ã‚Œ re, ã‚� ro have neither anything in common for r, nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the k set.
