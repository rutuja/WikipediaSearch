It is situated on the Abens river, a tributary of the Danube.The town lies on the Abens river, a tributary of the Danube, around eight kilometres from the rivers source. The area around Abensberg is characterized by the narrow valley of the Danube, where the Weltenburg Abbey stands, the valley of the AltmÃ¼hl in the north, a left tributary of the Danube, and the famous Hallertau Humulus|hops-planting region in the south. The town is divided into the municipalities of Abensberg, Arnhofen, Holzharland, HÃ¶rlbach, Offenstetten, Pullach and Sandharland.==Since the administrative reforms in Bavaria in the 1970s, the town also encompasses the following Quarter (country subdivision)|Ortsteile:* In the town: Abensberg (main settlement), Aunkofen (civil parish), Badhaus (village)* To the east: Gaden (village), See (village), Offenstetten (civil parish)* To the north east: Arnhofen (civil parish), Baiern (village), Pullach (civil parish), Kleedorf (village)* To the north: Sandharlanden (civil parish), Holzharlanden (civil parish), Buchhof (small Hamlet (place)|hamlet)* To the west: Schwaighausen (village), Schillhof (hamlet), Gilla (small hamlet)* To the south: AumÃ¼hle (small hamlet), Allersdorf (hamlet)* To the south east: Lehen (small hamlet), MitterhÃ¶rlbach (hamlet), Upper HÃ¶rlbach (village), Lower HÃ¶rlbach (hamlet)There had been settlement on this part of the Abens river since long before the High Middle Ages, dating back to Neolithic times. Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, Stone Age people made flint, which was fashioned into drills, blades and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the 3rd century Roman castra (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, in the middle of the 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of Habensperch, came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.In 1256, the castrum of Abensprech was first mentioned, and on 12 June 1348, Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg, and his brother, Stephen, Duke of Bavaria, raised Abensberg to the status of a city, giving it the right to operate lower courts, enclose itself with a wall and hold markets. The wall was built by Ulrich III, Count of Abensberg. Some of the thirty-two round towers and eight turrets are still preserved to this day.In the Middle Ages, the people of Abensberg enjoyed a level of autonomy above their lord. They elected a city council, although only a small number of rich families were eligible for election. Dukes of Duke of Electorate of Napoleon gained a significant victory over the Austrians under Archduke Louis of Austria and General Johann von Hiller. == The arms of the city are divided into two halves. On the left are the blue and white rhombuses of Bavaria, while the right half is split into two sliver and black triangles. Two diagonally-crossed silver swords with golden handles rest on top.The town has had a coat of arms since 1338, that of the Counts of Abensberg. With the death of the last Count, Nicholas of Abensberg, in 1485, the estates fell to the Duchy of Bavaria-Munich, meaning that henceforth only the Bavarian coat of arms was ever used. King Maximilian of Bavaria granted the city a new coat of arms, as a recognition of their (mainly humanitarian and logistic) services in the Battle of Abensberg the same year. The diagonally divided field in silver and black came from the old crest of the Counts of Abensberg, while the white and blue diamonds came from that of the House of Wittelsbach, the rulers of Bavaria. The swords recall the Battle of Abensberg.The district of Offenstetten previously possessed its own coat of arms.==* Parga in Greece since 1986* Lonigo in Italy since 1999The area around Abensberg, the so-called sand belt between Siegburg, Neustadt an der Donau, Abensberg and Langquaid, is used for the intensive farming of asparagus, due to the optimal soil condition and climate. 212 hectares of land can produce ninety-four asparagus plants.

In addition to asparagus, the production of hops plays a major role locally, the region having its own label, and there are still three independent breweries in the area.
