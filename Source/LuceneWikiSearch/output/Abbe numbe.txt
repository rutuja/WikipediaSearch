Abbe numbercomponent additions on the Abbe number of a specific base glass. ]] transparent material, dispersion (variation of refractive index with wavelength) in relation to the refractive index. It is named after Ernst Abbe (1840â€“1905), the German physicist who defined it.The Abbe number V of a material is defined as: V = \frac{ n_d - 1 }{ n_F - n_C },  Fraunhofer d-, chromatic aberration) materials have high values of V. group velocity dispersion is used.Alternate definitions of the Abbe number are used in some contexts. The value V d  is given by:  V_d = \frac{n_d-1}{ n_F - n_C }  mercury E-line at 546.073&nbsp;nm::  V_e = \frac{n_e-1}{ n_{F} - n_{C}} where F and C are the blue and red cadmium lines at 480.0&nbsp;nm and 643.8&nbsp;nm, respectively.An Abbe diagram is produced by plotting the Abbe number V d  of a material versus its refractive index n d . Glasses can then be categorised by their composition and position on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the Schott Glass catalogue, or a 6-digit glass code. achromatic doublet lenses to minimize chromatic aberration.The following table lists standard wavelengths at which n is usually determined, indicated by subscripts.  For example, n D  is measured at 589.3&nbsp;nm:{| class="wikitable"|-! Î» in nm! Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofers symbol! Light source!
