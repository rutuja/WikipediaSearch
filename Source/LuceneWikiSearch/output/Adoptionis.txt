Adoptionisms  The Baptism of Christ,  when Jesus became one with God according to Adoptionism ]]Adoptionism, sometimes called dynamic monarchianism,  is a minority Christian belief that Jesus was adopted as Gods son (Son of God) at his Baptism of Jesus|baptism. According to Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphaniuss account of the Ebionites,  the group believed that Jesus was chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God. orthodox doctrine Jesus as eternally begotten of God.  Luke and Matthew were Son (rendered as existing "in the beginning".

They were located in and about Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem, perhaps in the Cenacle, and proclaimed that  Jesus was the promised Messiah. These early Jewish Christians were thought to have been called Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes. The term Nazarene was first applied to Jesus.   and later to the Jewish Sect that believed Jesus was the Messiah.  It is close to an historical certainty that Matthew belonged to this group. Some believe that the non-canonical Gospel of the Hebrews or the Gospel of the Apostles     Matthew, the tax collector and later an Apostle, composed his gospel near Jerusalem for Hebrew Christians. It was then translated into Greek but the Greek copy was lost. The Hebrew original was preserved at the Library of Caesarea, which Pamphilus diligently gathered. The Nazarenes transcribed a copy for Jerome which he used in his work."Jerome, On Illustrious Men 3">Jerome, On Illustrious Men 3    was an early account of the  s account, when Jesus is baptized it states, "Jesus came up from the water, Heaven was opened, and He saw the Holy Spirit descend in the form of a dove and enter into Him. And a voice from Heaven said, â€˜You are my beloved Son; with You I am well pleased.â€™ And again, â€˜Today I have begotten You.â€™  Immediately a great light shone around the place."     fall of Jerusalem, and near universal, scholarly consensus holds that it was the first written of the four canonical gospels.              The phrase "Son of God" is not present in some early manuscripts at Mk 1:1.  Ehrman uses this omission to support the notion that the title "Son of God" is not used of Jesus until his baptism, and that Mark reflects an adoptionist view. The words, "Today I have begotten you," are omitted from the canonical Gospel of Mark, however, and it is therefore generally believed to have less adoptionist tendencies than the Gospel of the Hebrews. Pauls writings do not mention a Virgin birth of Christ, and some contend that Paul had never heard of it . Paul wrote that Jesus was "born of a woman, born under the law" and "as to his human nature was a descendant of David" in the Epistle to the Galatians and  the Epistle to the Romans. The Epistle to the Hebrews states   that God said, "You are my son. Today I have begotten you," a phrase that shows adoptionist tendencies.  It is also almost a direct quote from the second Psalm.  ==The Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written several years after Pauls letters.  The authors composed their gospels based on earlier Christian documents such as the Q Gospel and the Gospel of Mark.  In the 2nd century, adoptionism was one of two competing doctrines about the nature of Jesus Christ, the other (perhaps endorsed in the Gospel of John) being that he pre-existed as some sort of divine concept, agency, or spirit (the Logos of God). Historically, there were three waves of Adoptionist speculation if we exclude the hypothetical beliefs of the primitive church that cannot be determined with certainty. The first, which dates from the 2nd century, differs significantly from the subsequent two (dating respectively from the 8th and the 12th century), which follow the definition of the dogma of the Trinity and Chalcedonian Christology. trinitarians claim that the doctrine implicitly denies it.  Under Adoptionism Jesus is currently divine and has been since his adoption, although he is not equal to the Father. Adoptionism was one position in a long series of Christian disagreements about the precise nature of Christ (see Christology) in the developing dogma of the Trinity, an attempt to explain the relationship between Jesus of Nazareth, both as man and (now) God, and God the Father while identifying as monotheistic. It differs significantly from the doctrine of the Trinity that was later affirmed by the ecumenical councils.==The first known exponent of Adoptionism in the 2nd century is Theodotus of Byzantium. He taught  that Jesus was a man born of a virgin according to the Council of Jerusalem, that he lived like other men, and was most pious; but that at his baptism in the Jordan the Christ came down upon the man Jesus in the likeness of a dove. Therefore wonders (dynameis) were not wrought in him until the Spirit (which Theodotus called Christ) came down and was manifested in Him.  The belief was declared heretical by Pope Victor I.The 2nd-century work Shepherd of Hermas also taught that Jesus was a virtuous man filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son.   While the Shepherd of Hermas was popular and sometimes bound with the canonical scriptures, it didnt retain canonical status, if it ever had it.In the 3rd century, Paul of Samosata, Patriarch of Antioch, promoted adoptionism. He said Jesus had been a man who kept himself sinless and achieved union with God. His views, however, did not neatly fit in either of the two main forms of Monarchianism.  == Umayyad and Kingdom of Asturias|Christian-held regions of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th and 9th centuries. The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop Elipandus of Toledo that â€“ in respect to his human nature â€“ Christ was adoptive Son of God. Another leading advocate of this Christology was Felix of Urgel. In Spain, Adoptionism was opposed by Beatus of Liebana, and in the Carolingian territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by Pope Hadrian I, Alcuin of York, Agobard, and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794). Despite the shared name of "Adoptionism" the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the Adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term adoptivus of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son "emptied himself" of divinity  and "took the form of a servant" (Philippians 2:7), Christs human nature was "adopted" as divine. Historically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of â€œNestorianâ€� Christology.  John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his important study, The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785-820. ==A third wave was the revived form ("Neo-Adoptionism") of Peter Abelard in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century. Duns Scotus (1300) and Durandus of Saint-PourÃ§ain (1320) admit the term Filius adoptivus in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit Gabriel VÃ¡squez, and the Lutheran divines Georgius Calixtus and Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch, have defended adoptionism as essentially orthodox.== virgin birth was increasingly denied by Unitarians  . In the 19th century the term  Psilanthropism, was applied by such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge who so called his own view that Jesus was the son of Joseph. )==In his novel Slaughterhouse Five, Kurt Vonnegut makes reference to a fictional work called "The Gospel from Outer Space," which is exactly like the canonical gospels, but it involves an Adoptionist scene during the Crucifixion. It appears Vonnegut was unaware that this was already an existing theology, and that he came up with it independently.
