Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis viral infection parasitic infection, or even appear spontaneously. As it involves autoimmune demyelination, it is similar to multiple sclerosis, and is considered part of the Multiple sclerosis borderline     diseases. The incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year.     Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and Adolescence|adolescents, with the average age around 5 to 8 years old.      The mortality rate may be as high as 5%, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75% of cases, while up to 70 to 90% recover with some minor residual disability.    The average time to recover is one to six months. inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter. Usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord,  but periventricular white matter  and gray matter of the Cerebral cortex|cortex, thalami and basal ganglia   may also be involved.When the patient suffers more than one demyelinating episode, it is called Recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis  or Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis   (MDEM). influenza virus, CNS tissue, have ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.  seizures and coma. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days.  Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies. No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids,  such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3â€“6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone.  Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing,   and tend to show poorer outcomes . Other antiinflamatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg),       mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used, or fail to show an effect.There is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately In a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.  A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids.  A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor.  This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to a IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset. mRS or Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS), average time to recover is one to six months.  The mortality rate may be as high as 5%.  Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes.  The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present.==Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis. == verbal IQ performance IQ, affect (two children). Group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS. Another study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls.  Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.   borderline forms to constitute a spectrum, differing only in chronicity, severity, and clinical course,   while others consider them discretely different diseases. Problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of Multiple Sclerosis.  For some people MS should be considered a clinical entity based in inflammatory lesions separated in time and space.    As some cases of ADEM satisfy these conditions, they should be considered inside the MS spectrum. Using a pathological definition instead, they would be apart (plaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined).  necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage, and edema.    Death is common in the first week    and overall mortality is about 70%,  but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange.  About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits,  but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the magnitude of the white matter affected. This disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease, septicemia associated with immune complex deposition, methanol poisoning, and other underlying conditions. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of CNS inflammation and demyelination frequently used to investigate potential MS treatments.  An acute monophasic illness, EAE is far more similar to ADEM than MS.  Optic neuritis* Transverse myelitis    at myelitis.org* *
