AbrahamAbraham ( :  ,   &nbsp;Avrohom or Avruhom,     of the Abrahamic religions, among which are Judaism, Christianity and Islam. According to both the Hebrew Bible Genesis chapters 11-25  and the Quran, through his sons Ishmael and Isaac, Abraham is the forefather of many tribes, including the Ishmaelites, Israelites, Midianites and Edomites.   Abraham was a descendant of Noahs son, Shem.   Christians believe that Jesus was a descendant of Abraham through Isaac, and Muslims believe that Muhammad was also descendant of Abraham through Ishmael.  covenant established between him and God in Abrahamic religions|God.   The Quran has stories about Abraham and his offspring that are similar to the Bibles.   In Islam, Abraham is recognised as a prophet, patriarch and Apostle (Islam)|messenger, archetype of the perfect Muslim, and reformer     of the Kaaba. Mecca, Martin Lings, c. 2004 Joseph Blenkinsopp said that the Genesis story of Abraham has not been transmitted by  s dealings with their ancestors provided a historical foundation on which hope for the future could be built.   p.246  Abrahams association with Mamre and Hebron, in the south, in the territory of Jerusalem and Judah, suggests that this region was the original home of his cult.    Some oral traditions, however, may still hold an earlier history. == Akkadian "the father loves",  but scholars would prefer an origin based on Hebrew.== Samaritan version of the Torah at 2247 AM. All three agree that he died at the age of 175.  There have been over two hundred attempts to match the biblical chronology to dates in history, two of the more influential being the traditional Jewish dates (Abraham lived 1812 BCE to 1637 BCE), and those of the 17th century Archbishop James Ussher (1976 BCE to 1801 BCE); but the most that can be said with some degree of certainty is that the standard Hebrew text of Genesis places Abraham in the earlier part of the second millennium BCE. ==  It is generally recognised by scholars that there is nothing in the Genesis stories that can be related to the history of   (they did not arrive until centuries later),   ; the second is that he became, in the Persian period, a model for those who would return from Babylon to Judah.  Beyond this the Abraham story (and those of Isaac and Jacob/Israel) served a theological purpose following the destruction of Jerusalem, the Temple and the Davidic kingship: despite the loss of these things, Yahwehs dealings with the ancestors provided a historical foundation on which hope for the future could be built.  There is basic agreement that his connection with Haran, Shechem and Bethel is secondary and originated when he became identified as the father of Jacob and ancestor of the northern tribes; his association with Mamre and Hebron, on the other hand (in the south, in the territory of Jerusalem and Judah), suggest that this region was the original home of his cult. The life of Abraham is recorded in   of the Hebrew Bible. ]]==  from the 1865 La Sainte Bible)]]Terah, the tenth in descent from Noah, fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran, and Haran fathered Lot (Bible)|Lot.

Abram then moved to the hill country east of Bethel and built an altar to God there and invoked God by name, and journeyed toward the Negeb (the south).==There was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, travelled south to  Ancient Egypt|Egypt. En route, Abram told his wife Sarai, to say that she was his sister, so that the Egyptians would not kill him. ( ) When they entered Egypt, the princes of Pharaoh praised Sarais beauty to the Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace, and Abram was given provisions: "oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels." However, God afflicted the Pharaoh and his household with great plagues, ( ) and after discovering that Sarai was really Abrams wife, the Pharaoh wanted nothing to do with them.

The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. Though he released the captives, Abram refused any reward from the King of Sodom, other than the share his allies were entitled to. ( )==  from the 1860 Bible in Pictures)]]The word of God came to Abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars. Abram and God made a covenant ceremony, and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt. God described to Abram the land that his offspring would claim: "the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.â€� ( )==  , Sarah and Hagar, imagined here in a Bible illustration from 1897.]]Abram and Sarai were trying to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations since it had already been 10 years of living in Canaan, and still no child had been born from Abrams seed. Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaid, Hagar, for Abram to consort with so that she may have a child by her, as a wife. Abram consented and had sexual intercourse with Hagar. The result of these actions created a fiery relationship between Hagar and Sarai. ( )After a harsh encounter with Sarai, Hagar fled toward  . Hagar then referred to God as â€œEl Roi|El-roiâ€�, meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her. From that day, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. She then did as she was instructed by returning to Abram in order to have her child. Abram was eighty-six years of age when Ishmael was born. ( )==  records the inauguration of Abram into Godâ€™s covenant that was initiated thirteen years ago, as was stated in Genesis 15. Abram is now ninety-nine when God declares Abramâ€™s new name: â€œAbraham, a father of many nations.â€� Abram then received the instructions for the inauguration rite into Godâ€™s covenant because the time was approaching for him to have a son by his wife, Sarai. The initiation rite was that in order to be part of this â€œgreat nationâ€�, whether by bloodline or inducted, every male must be  â€� and blessed her. Immediately after Abramâ€™s encounter with his God, he had his entire household of men, including himself and Ishmael, circumcised. ( )==  )]] terebinths of bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread of which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarahâ€™s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate. ( )One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired to Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child for her age as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.==  After eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the Cities of the Plain to discuss the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abrahamâ€™s nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors leave for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to the Lord and pleaded with him that if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city? For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city. ( )When the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abrahamâ€™s nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two â€œmenâ€� stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lotâ€™s home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may â€œknowâ€� them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break Lotâ€™s doors down to get to his male guests,  thus confirming the â€œoutcry against Sodom and Gomorrahâ€� and sealing their doom. ( )Early the next morning, Abraham awoke and went to the elevation that looked over the River Jordan plain, at the very spot where he stood before God, the day prior. From his vantage point, he saw what became of the cities of the plain as â€œdense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.â€� ( ) This meant that there was not even ten righteous people in any of those cities. ( )== Kadesh and Shur in the land of the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King Abimelech had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman to a prophet of God. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he this God would slay an innocent man, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continues to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. ( )Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that Gerar of Philistia had no fear of God in them and the only way for this kingdom to recognize the fear of God was to do what he had done. Then Abraham justified what he had said as not being a lie at all: "And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife." ( ) Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, then gave him sheep, oxen, and slaves, and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelechâ€™s lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarahs vindication before all. Abraham then prayed in behalf of Abimelech and the women in his household, so that they bore children, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah.

As a reward for his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. After this event, Abraham did not return to Hebron, Sarahs encampment, but instead went to Beersheba, Keturahs encampment, and it is to Beersheba that Abrahams servant brought Rebecca, Isaacs patrilineal parallel cousin who became his wife. ==Sarah is said to have died at the age of 127, and Abraham buried her in the Cave of the Patriarchs (also called the Cave of Machpelah), near Hebron which he had purchased, along with the adjoining field, from Ephron the Biblical Hittites|Hittite.After the death of Sarah, he took another wife, or  , Jokshan, Medan (son of Abraham)|Medan, Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  Commentary on    The Bible says he was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael in the Cave of the Patriarchs.  This is a summary of all the references to Abraham in the QuranThere are numerous references to Abraham in the   in 6:74, to leave idol-worship and come to the worship of  s people in   as the following verses mention the birth of   (29: 49)  and Ishmael (2: 132-133). In the later chapters of the Quran, Abrahams role becomes yet more prominent. The Quran mentions that Abraham and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the   as the "religion of Abraham" (millat Ibrahim) (2: 135) and Abraham is given a title as Hanif (The Pure; 3: 67). The Quran also mentions Abraham as one whom God took as a friend (Khalil; 4: 125), hence Abrahams title in Islam, Khalil-Allah (Friend of God) (The term, however, is but a derivation of the Patriarchs Hebrew title, Kal El ( ×§×œ-×�×œ), which means "voice of God").    Other instances in the Quran which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of Abraham from the fire into which he was thrown by his people (37: 97; 21: 68-70); his pleading for his father (28: 47); his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful king (2: 58) and the miracle of the dead birds (2: 260).All these events and more have been discussed with more details in Muslim tradition, and especially in the Stories of the Prophets and works of universal Islamic theology.  Certain episodes from the life of Abraham have been more heavily detailed in Islamic text, such as the arguments between Abraham and the evil king Nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of Hagar and Ishmael, which Muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in Mecca. Some believe in some cases, these legends in Islamic text may have influenced later Jewish tradition. In Islamic and Jewish traditions, Abraham is referred to as "our Father" (Hebrew: Avraham Avinu, Arabic: abeena Ibraheem ).In Islamic tradition, Abraham is considered a prophet of Islam, the ancestor of Muhammad, through his firstborn son, Ishmael whose motherâ€™s name is nowhere mentioned in the Quran.In Jewish tradition, Abraham is also the father of the Israelites through his second born child, Isaac whose mother was Sarah. Accordingly, the mother of his firstborn son, Ishmael is identified as Hagar (Bible)|Hagar, Sarahâ€™s Egyptian handmaiden.In Christian tradition, Gods promise to Abraham would be fulfilled, in its entirety, through Jesus Christ who provides the opportunity for all mankind to be under the same covenant that was offered to Abraham and all of his people. ==Abrahamâ€™s life can be read in the weekly   ( ×œÖ¶×šÖ°-×œÖ°×šÖ¸ ), Vayeira ( ×•Ö·×™ÖµÖ¼×¨Ö¸×� ), Chayei Sarah ( ×—Ö·×™ÖµÖ¼×™ ×©Ö¸×‚×¨Ö¸×” ), and Toledot ( ×ªÖ¼×•Ö¹×œÖ°×“Ö¹×ª )Rabbinic Judaism (i.e., Judaism in its modern form, as it developed after the 1st century CE) faced a problem with Abraham, in that he lived before the Torah had been revealed to Moses; in the light of this fact, could he be counted as a true follower of the Law? He had, of course, the instruction to practice circumcision, but of the rest of the law he knew nothing. The rabbis (traditional teachers and interpreters of the Torah) solved this by declaring that Abraham had in fact known and practiced the Law in its entirety, despite the lack of evidence in Genesis or elsewhere.Abramâ€™s birthplace disputed 11th and 12th century Rabbis  ian city-state of Ur.   However, this Persian Gulf city in Iraq is only a candidate among others to be the actual Ur KaÅ›dim, as well as the most popularly debated one since 1927.   The city of Urfa (classical Urha <Ur of Haran) in Turkey, not too far from Haran also claims to the birthplace of the Patriarch. Urfa  is famous for its monuments, pools and shrines associated with Patriarch Abraham.Rabbi Nahmanides, known as the Ramban, was a medieval Jewish scholar of the 13th century who disagreed with Rashi and Ibn Ezra concerning Abramâ€™s birthplace. The Ramban states that because Ur KaÅ›dim was settled by Hamâ€™s descendants, this could not be Abramâ€™s birthplace as he was a descendant of Shem. However, everyone does agree that Abramâ€™s family under the headship of his father, Terah|Terach, had all lived in Ur KaÅ›dim before being called to move to Land of Canaan|Canaan. The three Rabbis also agree that Terachâ€™s native homeland was Charan, the biblical place known as Haran in  , where the House of Terach was located.   Since this settlement was established by Shemâ€™s descendants, only Ramban assumed that Charan had to be Abramâ€™s birthplace. He further concluded that Terach and his three sons eventually moved from Charan to Ur KaÅ›dim, then later by Godâ€™s command, they headed to Canaan. Of course, they stopped back at Terachâ€™s hometown of Charan, where the father stayed there rather than going to Canaan after all. ==   in Charleston, South Carolina]] Hebrews 11), Paul uses Galatians  ). type of his Son on Golgotha.The traditional view in Christianity is that the chief promise made to Abraham in Genesis 12 is that through Abrahams seed all the people of earth would be blessed. Notwithstanding this, John the Baptist specifically taught that merely being of Abrahams seed was no guarantee of salvation.  The promise in Genesis is considered to have been fulfilled through Abrahams seed, Jesus. It is also a consequence of this promise that Christianity is open to people of all races and not limited to Jews.
